<h1>Kim</h1>

<h3>by Rudyard Kipling</h3>

<h2><br>
 Chapter I</h2>

<p><br>
 O ye who tread the Narrow Way<br>
 By Tophet-flare to judgment Day,<br>
 Be gentle when 'the heathen' pray<br>
 To Buddha at Kamakura!</p>

<p>Buddha at Kamakura.</p>

<p>He sat, in defiance of municipal orders, astride the gun
Zam<br>
 Zammah on her brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -<br>
 the Wonder House, as the natives call the Lahore Museum.<br>
 Who hold Zam-Zammah, that 'fire-breathing dragon', hold the<br>
 Punjab, for the great green-bronze piece is always first of
the<br>
 conqueror's loot.</p>

<p>There was some justification for Kim - he had kicked Lala<br>
 Dinanath's boy off the trunnions - since the English held
the<br>
 Punjab and Kim was English. Though he was burned black as
any<br>
 native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and
his<br>
 mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he<br>
 consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of
the<br>
 bazar; Kim was white - a poor white of the very poorest. The<br>
 half-caste woman who looked after him (she smoked opium, and<br>
 pretended to keep a second-hand furniture shop by the square<br>
 where the cheap cabs wait) told the missionaries that she
was<br>
 Kim's mother's sister; but his mother had been nursemaid in
a<br>
 Colonel's family and had married Kimball O'Hara, a young
colour-<br>
 sergeant of the Mavericks, an Irish regiment. He afterwards
took<br>
 a post on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, and his
Regiment<br>
 went home without him. The wife died of cholera in
Ferozepore,<br>
 and O'Hara fell to drink and loafing up and down the line
with<br>
 the keen-eyed three-year-old baby. Societies and chaplains,<br>
 anxious for the child, tried to catch him, but O'Hara
drifted<br>
 away, till he came across the woman who took opium and
learned<br>
 the taste from her, and died as poor whites die in India.
His<br>
 estate at death consisted of three papers - one he called his
'ne<br>
 varietur' because those words were written below his
signature<br>
 thereon, and another his 'clearance-certificate'. The third
was<br>
 Kim's birth-certificate. Those things, he was used to say, in
his<br>
 glorious opium-hours, would yet make little Kimball a man. On
no<br>
 account was Kim to part with them, for they belonged to a
great<br>
 piece of magic - such magic as men practised over yonder
behind<br>
 the Museum, in the big blue-and-white Jadoo-Gher - the Magic<br>
 House, as we name the Masonic Lodge. It would, he said, all
come<br>
 right some day, and Kim's horn would be exalted between pillars
-<br>
 monstrous pillars - of beauty and strength. The Colonel
himself,<br>
 riding on a horse, at the head of the finest Regiment in the<br>
 world, would attend to Kim - little Kim that should have
been<br>
 better off than his father. Nine hundred first-class devils,<br>
 whose God was a Red Bull on a green field, would attend to
Kim,<br>
 if they had not forgotten O'Hara - poor O'Hara that was
gang-<br>
 foreman on the Ferozepore line. Then he would weep bitterly
in<br>
 the broken rush chair on the veranda. So it came about after
his<br>
 death that the woman sewed parchment, paper, and birth-<br>
 certificate into a leather amulet-case which she strung
round<br>
 Kim's neck.</p>

<p><br>
 'And some day,' she said, confusedly remembering O'Hara's<br>
 prophecies, 'there will come for you a great Red Bull on a
green<br>
 field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and'<br>
 dropping into English - 'nine hundred devils.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' said Kim, 'I shall remember. A Red Bull and a Colonel on
a<br>
 horse will come, but first, my father said, will come the two
men<br>
 making ready the ground for these matters. That is how my
father<br>
 said they always did; and it is always so when men work
magic.'</p>

<p>If the woman had sent Kim up to the local Jadoo-Gher with
those<br>
 papers, he would, of course, have been taken over by the<br>
 Provincial Lodge, and sent to the Masonic Orphanage in the
Hills;<br>
 but what she had heard of magic she distrusted. Kim, too,
held<br>
 views of his own. As he reached the years of indiscretion,
he<br>
 learned to avoid missionaries and white men of serious aspect
who<br>
 asked who he was, and what he did. For Kim did nothing with
an<br>
 immense success. True, he knew the wonderful walled city of<br>
 Lahore from the Delhi Gate to the outer Fort Ditch; was hand
in<br>
 glove with men who led lives stranger than anything Haroun
al<br>
 Raschid dreamed of; and he lived in a life wild as that of
the<br>
 Arabian Nights, but missionaries and secretaries of
charitable<br>
 societies could not see the beauty of it. His nickname
through<br>
 the wards was 'Little Friend of all the World'; and very
often,<br>
 being lithe and inconspicuous, he executed commissions by
night<br>
 on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of<br>
 fashion. It was intrigue, - of course he knew that much, as
he<br>
 had known all evil since he could speak, - but what he loved
was<br>
 the game for its own sake - the stealthy prowl through the
dark<br>
 gullies and lanes, the crawl up a waterpipe, the sights and<br>
 sounds of the women's world on the flat roofs, and the
headlong<br>
 flight from housetop to housetop under cover of the hot
dark.<br>
 Then there were holy men, ash-smeared fakirs by their brick<br>
 shrines under the trees at the riverside, with whom he was
quite<br>
 familiar - greeting them as they returned from
begging-tours,<br>
 and, when no one was by, eating from the same dish. The woman
who<br>
 looked after him insisted with tears that he should wear
European<br>
 clothes - trousers, a shirt and a battered hat. Kim found it<br>
 easier to slip into Hindu or Mohammedan garb when engaged on<br>
 certain businesses. One of the young men of fashion - he who
was<br>
 found dead at the bottom of a well on the night of the
earthquake<br>
 had once given him a complete suit of Hindu kit, the costume<br>
 of a lowcaste street boy, and Kim stored it in a secret
place<br>
 under some baulks in Nila Ram's timber-yard, beyond the
Punjab<br>
 High Court, where the fragrant deodar logs lie seasoning
after<br>
 they have driven down the Ravi. When there was business or
frolic<br>
 afoot, Kim would use his properties, returning at dawn to
the<br>
 veranda, all tired out from shouting at the heels of a
marriage<br>
 procession, or yelling at a Hindu festival. Sometimes there
was<br>
 food in the house, more often there was not, and then Kim
went<br>
 out again to eat with his native friends.</p>

<p>As he drummed his heels against Zam-Zammah he turned now
and<br>
 again from his king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal
and<br>
 Abdullah the sweetmeat-seller's son, to make a rude remark to
the<br>
 native policeman on guard over rows of shoes at the Museum
door.<br>
 The big Punjabi grinned tolerantly: he knew Kim of old. So
did<br>
 the water-carrier, sluicing water on the dry road from his
goat-<br>
 skin bag. So did Jawahir Singh, the Museum carpenter, bent
over<br>
 new packing-cases. So did everybody in sight except the
peasants<br>
 from the country, hurrying up to the Wonder House to view
the<br>
 things that men made in their own province and elsewhere.
The<br>
 Museum was given up to Indian arts and manufactures, and
anybody<br>
 who sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain.</p>

<p>'Off ! Off ! Let me up!' cried Abdullah, climbing up
ZamZammah's<br>
 wheel.</p>

<p>'Thy father was a pastry-cook, Thy mother stole the ghi"
sang<br>
 Kim. 'All Mussalmans fell off Zam-Zammah long ago!'</p>

<p>'Let me up!' shrilled little Chota Lal in his
gilt-embroidered<br>
 cap. His father was worth perhaps half a million sterling,
but<br>
 India is the only democratic land in the world.</p>

<p>'The Hindus fell off Zam-Zammah too. The Mussalmans pushed
them<br>
 off. Thy father was a pastry-cook -'</p>

<p>He stopped; for there shuffled round the corner, from the
roaring<br>
 Motee Bazar, such a man as Kim, who thought he knew all
castes,<br>
 had never seen. He was nearly six feet high, dressed in fold
upon<br>
 fold of dingy stuff like horse-blanketing, and not one fold of
it<br>
 could Kim refer to any known trade or profession. At his
belt<br>
 hung a long open-work iron pencase and a wooden rosary such
as<br>
 holy men wear. On his head was a gigantic sort of
tam-o'-shanter.<br>
 His face was yellow and wrinkled, like that of Fook Shing,
the<br>
 Chinese bootmaker in the bazar. His eyes turned up at the
corners<br>
 and looked like little slits of onyx.</p>

<p>'Who is that?' said Kim to his companions.</p>

<p>'Perhaps it is a man,' said Abdullah, finger in mouth,
staring.</p>

<p>'Without doubt.' returned Kim; 'but he is no man of India that
I<br>
 have ever seen.'</p>

<p>'A priest, perhaps,' said Chota Lal, spying the rosary. 'See!
He<br>
 goes into the Wonder House!'</p>

<p>'Nay, nay,' said the policeman, shaking his head. 'I do
not<br>
 understand your talk.' The constable spoke Punjabi. 'O Friend
of<br>
 all the World, what does he say?'</p>

<p>'Send him hither,' said Kim, dropping from Zam-Zammah,<br>
 flourishing his bare heels. 'He is a foreigner, and thou art
a<br>
 buffalo.'</p>

<p>The man turned helplessly and drifted towards the boys. He
was<br>
 old, and his woollen gaberdine still reeked of the stinking<br>
 artemisia of the mountain passes.</p>

<p>'O Children, what is that big house?' he said in very fair
Urdu.</p>

<p>'The Ajaib-Gher, the Wonder House!' Kim gave him no title -
such<br>
 as Lala or Mian. He could not divine the man's creed.</p>

<p>'Ah! The Wonder House! Can any enter?'</p>

<p>'It is written above the door - all can enter.'</p>

<p>'Without payment?'</p>

<p>'I go in and out. I am no banker,' laughed Kim.</p>

<p>'Alas! I am an old man. I did not know.' Then, fingering
his<br>
 rosary, he half turned to the Museum.</p>

<p>'What is your caste? Where is your house? Have you come far?'
Kim<br>
 asked.</p>

<p>'I came by Kulu - from beyond the Kailas - but what know
you?<br>
 &gt;From the Hills where' - he sighed - 'the air and water are
fresh<br>
 and cool.'</p>

<p>'Aha! Khitai [a Chinaman],' said Abdullah proudly. Fook Shing
had<br>
 once chased him out of his shop for spitting at the joss
above<br>
 the boots.</p>

<p>'Pahari [a hillman],' said little Chota Lal.</p>

<p>'Aye, child - a hillman from hills thou'lt never see. Didst
hear<br>
 of Bhotiyal [Tibet]? I am no Khitai, but a Bhotiya
[Tibetan],<br>
 since you must know - a lama - or, say, a guru in your
tongue.'</p>

<p>'A guru from Tibet,' said Kim. 'I have not seen such a man.
They<br>
 be Hindus in Tibet, then?'</p>

<p>'We be followers of the Middle Way, living in peace in our<br>
 lamasseries, and I go to see the Four Holy Places before I
die.<br>
 Now do you, who are children, know as much as I do who am
old.'<br>
 He smiled benignantly on the boys.</p>

<p>'Hast thou eaten?'</p>

<p>He fumbled in his bosom and drew forth a worn, wooden
begging-<br>
 bowl. The boys nodded. All priests of their acquaintance
begged.</p>

<p>'I do not wish to eat yet.' He turned his head like an.
old<br>
 tortoise in the sunlight. 'Is it true that there are many
images<br>
 in the Wonder House of Lahore?' He repeated the last words as
one<br>
 making sure of an address.</p>

<p>'That is true,' said Abdullah. 'It is full of heathen buts.
Thou<br>
 also art an idolater.'</p>

<p>'Never mind him,' said. Kim. 'That is the Government's house
and<br>
 there is no idolatry in it, but only a Sahib with a white
beard.<br>
 Come with me and I will show.'</p>

<p>'Strange priests eat boys,' whispered Chota Lal.</p>

<p>'And he is a stranger and a but-parast [idolater],' said<br>
 Abdullah, the Mohammedan.</p>

<p>Kim laughed. 'He is new. Run to your mothers' laps, and be
safe.<br>
 Come!'</p>

<p>Kim clicked round the self-registering turnstile; the old
man<br>
 followed and halted amazed. In the entrance-hall stood the
larger<br>
 figures of the Greco-Buddhist sculptures done, savants know
how<br>
 long since, by forgotten workmen whose hands were feeling,
and<br>
 not unskilfully, for the mysteriously transmitted Grecian
touch.<br>
 There were hundreds of pieces, friezes of figures in relief,<br>
 fragments of statues and slabs crowded with figures that had<br>
 encrusted the brick walls of the Buddhist stupas and viharas
of<br>
 the North Country and now, dug up and labelled, made the pride
of<br>
 the Museum. In open-mouthed wonder the lama turned to this
and<br>
 that, and finally checked in rapt attention before a large
alto-<br>
 relief representing a coronation or apotheosis of the Lord<br>
 Buddha. The Master was represented seated on a lotus the
petals<br>
 of which were so deeply undercut as to show almost detached.<br>
 Round Him was an adoring hierarchy of kings, elders, and
old-time<br>
 Buddhas. Below were lotus-covered waters with fishes and
water-<br>
 birds. Two butterfly-winged dewas held a wreath over His
head;<br>
 above them another pair supported an umbrella surmounted by
the<br>
 jewelled headdress of the Bodhisat.</p>

<p>'The Lord! The Lord! It is Sakya Muni himself,' the lama
half<br>
 sobbed; and under his breath began the wonderful Buddhist<br>
 invocation:</p>

<p><br>
 To Him the Way, the Law, apart, Whom Maya held beneath her
heart,<br>
 Ananda's Lord, the Bodhisat.</p>

<p>'And He is here! The Most Excellent Law is here also. My<br>
 pilgrimage is well begun. And what work! What work!'</p>

<p>'Yonder is the Sahib.' said Kim, and dodged sideways among
the<br>
 cases of the arts and manufacturers wing. A white-bearded<br>
 Englishman was looking at the lama, who gravely turned and<br>
 saluted him and after some fumbling drew forth a note-book and
a<br>
 scrap of paper.</p>

<p>'Yes, that is my name,' smiling at the clumsy, childish
print.</p>

<p>'One of us who had made pilgrimage to the Holy Places - he is
now<br>
 Abbot of the Lung-Cho Monastery - gave it me,' stammered the<br>
 lama. 'He spoke of these.' His lean hand moved tremulously
round.</p>

<p>'Welcome, then, O lama from Tibet. Here be the images, and I
am<br>
 here' - he glanced at the lama's face - 'to gather
knowledge.<br>
 Come to my office awhile.' The old man was trembling with<br>
 excitement.</p>

<p>The office was but a little wooden cubicle partitioned off
from<br>
 the sculpture-lined gallery. Kim laid himself down, his ear<br>
 against a crack in the heat-split cedar door, and, following
his<br>
 instinct, stretched out to listen and watch.</p>

<p>Most of the talk was altogether above his head. The lama,<br>
 haltingly at first, spoke to the Curator of his own
lamassery,<br>
 the Such-zen, opposite the Painted Rocks, four months' march<br>
 away. The Curator brought out a huge book of photos and
showed<br>
 him that very place, perched on its crag, overlooking the<br>
 gigantic valley of many-hued strata.</p>

<p>'Ay, ay!' The lama mounted a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles
of<br>
 Chinese work. 'Here is the little door through which we
bring<br>
 wood before winter. And thou - the English know of these
things?<br>
 He who is now Abbot of Lung-Cho told me, but I did not
believe.<br>
 The Lord - the Excellent One - He has honour here too? And
His<br>
 life is known?'</p>

<p>'It is all carven upon the stones. Come and see, if thou
art<br>
 rested.'</p>

<p>Out shuffled the lama to the main hall, and, the Curator
beside<br>
 him, went through the collection with the reverence of a
devotee<br>
 and the appreciative instinct of a craftsman.</p>

<p>Incident by incident in the beautiful story he identified on
the<br>
 blurred stone, puzzled here and there by the unfamiliar
Greek<br>
 convention, but delighted as a child at each new trove. Where
the<br>
 sequence failed, as in the Annunciation, the Curator supplied
it<br>
 from his mound of books - French and German, with photographs
and<br>
 reproductions.</p>

<p>Here was the devout Asita, the pendant of Simeon in the
Christian<br>
 story, holding the Holy Child on his knee while mother and
father<br>
 listened; and here were incidents in the legend of the
cousin<br>
 Devadatta. Here was the wicked woman who accused the Master
of<br>
 impurity, all confounded; here was the teaching in the
Deer-park;<br>
 the miracle that stunned the fire-worshippers; here was the<br>
 Bodhisat in royal state as a prince; the miraculous birth;
the<br>
 death at Kusinagara, where the weak disciple fainted; while
there<br>
 were almost countless repetitions of the meditation under
the<br>
 Bodhi tree; and the adoration of the alms-bowl was everywhere.
In<br>
 a few minutes the Curator saw that his guest was no mere
bead-<br>
 telling mendicant, but a scholar of parts. And they went at
it<br>
 all over again, the lama taking snuff, wiping his spectacles,
and<br>
 talking at railway speed in a bewildering mixture of Urdu
and<br>
 Tibetan. He had heard of the travels of the Chinese pilgrims,
Fu-<br>
 Hiouen and Hwen-Tsiang, and was anxious to know if there was
any<br>
 translation of their record. He drew in his breath as he
turned<br>
 helplessly over the pages of Beal and Stanislas Julien. "Tis
all<br>
 here. A treasure locked.' Then he composed himself reverently
to<br>
 listen to fragments hastily rendered into Urdu. For the
first<br>
 time he heard of the labours of European scholars, who by
the<br>
 help of these and a hundred other documents have identified
the<br>
 Holy Places of Buddhism. Then he was shown a mighty map,
spotted<br>
 and traced with yellow. The brown finger followed the
Curator's<br>
 pencil from point to point. Here was Kapilavastu, here the
Middle<br>
 Kingdom, and here Mahabodhi, the Mecca of Buddhism; and here
was<br>
 Kusinagara, sad place of the Holy One's death. The old man
bowed<br>
 his head over the sheets in silence for a while, and the
Curator<br>
 lit another pipe. Kim had fallen asleep. When he waked, the
talk,<br>
 still in spate, was more within his comprehension.</p>

<p>'And thus it was, O Fountain of Wisdom, that I decided to go
to<br>
 the Holy Places which His foot had trod - to the Birthplace,
even<br>
 to Kapila; then to Mahabodhi, which is Buddh Gaya - to the<br>
 Monastery - to the Deer-park -to the place of His death.'</p>

<p>The lama lowered his voice. 'And I come here alone. For five
-<br>
 seven - eighteen - forty years it was in my mind that the Old
Law<br>
 was not well followed; being overlaid, as thou knowest, with<br>
 devildom, charms, and idolatry. Even as the child outside
said<br>
 but now. Ay, even as the child said, with but-parasti.'</p>

<p>'So it comes with all faiths.'</p>

<p>'Thinkest thou? The books of my lamassery I read, and they
were<br>
 dried pith; and the later ritual with which we of the
Reformed<br>
 Law have cumbered ourselves - that, too, had no worth to
these<br>
 old eyes. Even the followers of the Excellent One are at feud
on<br>
 feud with one another. It is all illusion. Ay, maya,
illusion.<br>
 But I have another desire' - the seamed yellow face drew
within<br>
 three inches of the Curator, and the long forefinger-nail
tapped<br>
 on the table. 'Your scholars, by these books, have followed
the<br>
 Blessed Feet in all their wanderings; but there are things
which<br>
 they have not sought out. I know nothing - nothing do I know
-<br>
 but I go to free myself from the Wheel of Things by a broad
and<br>
 open road.' He smiled with most simple triumph. 'As a pilgrim
to<br>
 the Holy Places I acquire merit. But there is more. Listen to
a<br>
 true thing. When our gracious Lord, being as yet a youth,
sought<br>
 a mate, men said, in His father's Court, that He was too
tender<br>
 for marriage. Thou knobbiest?'</p>

<p>The Curator nodded, wondering what would come next.<br>
 'So they made the triple trial of strength against all
comers.<br>
 And at the test of the Bow, our Lord first breaking that
which<br>
 they gave Him, called for such a bow as none might bend.
Thou<br>
 knowest?'</p>

<p>'It is written. I have read.'</p>

<p>'And, overshooting all other marks, the arrow passed far and
far<br>
 beyond sight. At the last it fell; and, where it touched
earth,<br>
 there broke out a stream which presently became a River,
whose<br>
 nature, by our Lord's beneficence, and that merit He acquired
ere<br>
 He freed himself, is that whoso bathes in it washes away all<br>
 taint and speckle of sin.'</p>

<p>'So it is written,' said the Curator sadly.</p>

<p>The lama drew a long breath. "Where is that River? Fountain
of<br>
 Wisdom, where fell the arrow?"</p>

<p>'Alas', my brother, I do not know,' said the Curator.</p>

<p>'Nay, if it please thee to forget - the one thing only that
thou<br>
 hast not told me. Surely thou must know? See, I am an old man!
I<br>
 ask with my head between thy feet, O Fountain of Wisdom. We
know<br>
 He drew the bow! We know the arrow fell! We know the stream<br>
 gushed! Where, then, is the River? My dream told me to find
it.<br>
 So I came. I am here. But where is the River?'</p>

<p>'If I knew, think you I would not cry it aloud?'</p>

<p>'By it one attains freedom from the Wheel of Things,' the
lama<br>
 went on, unheeding. 'The River of the Arrow! Think again!
Some<br>
 little stream, maybe - dried in the heats? But the Holy One
would<br>
 never so cheat an old man.'</p>

<p>'I do not know. I do not know.'</p>

<p>The lama brought his thousand-wrinkled face once more a<br>
 handsbreadth from the Englishman's. 'I see thou dost not
know.<br>
 Not being of the Law, the matter is hid from thee.'</p>

<p>'Ay - hidden - hidden.'</p>

<p>'We are both bound, thou and I, my brother. But I' - he rose
with<br>
 a sweep of the soft thick drapery - 'I go to cut myself
free.<br>
 Come also!'</p>

<p>'I am bound,' said the Curator. 'But whither goest thou?'</p>

<p>'First to Kashi [Benares]: where else? There I shall meet one
of<br>
 the pure faith in a Jain temple of that city. He also is a
Seeker<br>
 in secret, and from him haply I may learn. Maybe he will go
with<br>
 me to Buddh Gaya. Thence north and west to Kapilavastu, and
there<br>
 will I seek for the River. Nay, I will seek everywhere as I go
-<br>
 for the place is not known where the arrow fell.'</p>

<p>'And how wilt thou go? It is a far cry to Delhi, and farther
to<br>
 Benares.'</p>

<p>'By road and the trains. From Pathankot, having left the
Hills, I<br>
 came hither in a te-rain. It goes swiftly. At first I was
amazed<br>
 to see those tall poles by the side of the road snatching up
and<br>
 snatching up their threads,' - he illustrated the stoop and
whirl<br>
 of a telegraph-pole flashing past the train. 'But later, I
was<br>
 cramped and desired to walk, as I am used.'</p>

<p>'And thou art sure of thy road?' said the Curator.</p>

<p>'Oh. for that one but asks a question and pays money, and
the<br>
 appointed persons despatch all to the appointed place. That
much<br>
 I knew in my lamassery from sure report,' said the lama
proudly.</p>

<p>'And when dost thou go?' The Curator smiled at the mixture
of<br>
 old-world piety and modern progress that is the note of
India<br>
 today.</p>

<p>'As soon as may be. I follow the places of His life till I
come<br>
 to the River of the Arrow. There is, moreover, a written paper
of<br>
 the hours of the trains that go south.'</p>

<p>'And for food?' Lamas, as a rule, have good store of money<br>
 somewhere about them, but the Curator wished to make sure.</p>

<p>'For the journey, I take up the Master's begging-bowl. Yes.
Even<br>
 as He went so go I, forsaking the ease of my monastery. There
was<br>
 with me when I left the hills a chela [disciple] who begged
for<br>
 me as the Rule demands, but halting in Kulu awhile a fever
took<br>
 him and he died. I have now no chela, but I will take the
alms-<br>
 bowl and thus enable the charitable to acquire merit.' He
nodded<br>
 his head valiantly. Learned doctors of a lamassery do not
beg,<br>
 but the lama was an enthusiast in this quest.</p>

<p>'Be it so,' said the Curator, smiling. 'Suffer me now to
acquire<br>
 merit. We be craftsmen together, thou and I. Here is a new
book<br>
 of white English paper: here be sharpened pencils two and three
-<br>
 thick and thin, all good for a scribe. Now lend me thy
spectacles.'</p>

<p>The Curator looked through them. They were heavily scratched,
but<br>
 the power was almost exactly that of his own pair, which he
slid<br>
 into the lama's hand, saying: 'Try these.'</p>

<p>'A feather! A very feather upon the face? The old man turned
his<br>
 head delightedly and wrinkled up his nose. 'How scarcely do
I<br>
 feel them! How clearly do I see!</p>

<p>'They be, bilaur - crystal - and will never scratch. May
they<br>
 help thee to thy River, for they are thine.'</p>

<p>'I will take them and the pencils and the white note-book,'
said<br>
 the lama, 'as a sign of friendship between priest and priest
-<br>
 and now -' He fumbled at his belt, detached the open-work
iron<br>
 pincers, and laid it on the Curator's table. 'That is for a<br>
 memory between thee and me - my pencase. It is something old
-<br>
 even as I am.'</p>

<p>It was a piece of ancient design, Chinese, of an iron that is
not<br>
 smelted these days; and the collector's heart in the
Curator's<br>
 bosom had gone out to it from the first. For no persuasion
would<br>
 the lama resume his gift.</p>

<p>'When I return, having found the River, I will bring thee
a<br>
 written picture of the Padma Samthora such as I used to make
on<br>
 silk at the lamassery. Yes - and of the Wheel of Life,' he<br>
 chuckled, 'for we be craftsmen together, thou and I.'</p>

<p>The Curator would have detained him: they are few in the
world<br>
 who still have the secret of the conventional brush-pen
Buddhist<br>
 pictures which are, as it were, half written and half drawn.
But<br>
 the lama strode out, head high in air, and pausing an
instant<br>
 before the great statue of a Bodhisat in meditation, brushed<br>
 through the turnstiles.</p>

<p>Kim followed like a shadow. What he had overheard excited
him<br>
 wildly. This man was entirely new to all his experience, and
he<br>
 meant to investigate further, precisely as he would have<br>
 investigated a new building or a strange festival in Lahore
city.<br>
 The lama was his trove, and he purposed to take possession.
Kim's<br>
 mother had been Irish too.</p>

<p>The old man halted by Zam-Zammah and looked round till his
eye<br>
 fell on Kim. The inspiration of his pilgrimage had left him
for<br>
 awhile, and he felt old, forlorn, and very empty.</p>

<p>'Do not sit under that gun,' said the policeman loftily.</p>

<br>
'Huh! Owl!' was Kim's retort on the lama's behalf 'Sit under that
<br>
gun if it please thee. When didst thou steal the milkwoman's <br>
slippers, Dunnoo?'

<p>That was an utterly unfounded charge sprung on the spur of
the<br>
 moment, but it silenced Dunnoo, who knew that Kim's clear
yell<br>
 could call up legions of bad bazar boys if need arose.</p>

<p>'And whom didst thou worship within?' said Kim affably,
squatting<br>
 in the shade beside the lama.</p>

<p>'I worshipped none, child. I bowed before the Excellent
Law.'</p>

<p>Kim accepted this new God without emotion. He knew already a
few<br>
 score.</p>

<p>'And what dost thou do?'</p>

<p>'I beg. I remember now it is long since I have eaten or
drunk.<br>
 What is the custom of charity in this town? In silence, as we
do<br>
 of Tibet, or speaking aloud?'</p>

<p>'Those who beg in silence starve in silence,' said Kim,
quoting a<br>
 native proverb. The lama tried to rise, but sank back again,<br>
 sighing for his disciple, dead in far-away Kulu. Kim watched
head<br>
 to one side, considering and interested.</p>

<p>'Give me the bowl. I know the people of this city - all who
are<br>
 charitable. Give, and I will bring it back filled.'</p>

<p>Simply as a child the old man handed him the bowl.<br>
 [start here]<br>
 'Rest, thou. I know the people.'</p>

<p>He trotted off to the open shop of a kunjri, a low-caste<br>
 vegetable-seller, which lay opposite the belt-tramway line
down<br>
 the Motee Bazar. She knew Kim of old.</p>

<p>'Oho, hast thou turned yogi with thy begging-bowl?' she
cried.</p>

<p>'Nay.' said Kim proudly. 'There is a new priest in the city a
man<br>
 such as I have never seen.'</p>

<p>'Old priest - young tiger,' said the woman angrily. 'I am
tired<br>
 of new priests! They settle on our wares like flies. Is the<br>
 father of my son a well of charity to give to all who ask?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Kim. 'Thy man is rather yagi [bad-tempered] than
yogi<br>
 [a holy man]. But this priest is new. The Sahib in the
Wonder<br>
 House has talked to him like a brother. O my mother, fill me
this<br>
 bowl. He waits.'</p>

<p>'That bowl indeed! That cow-bellied basket! Thou hast as
much<br>
 grace as the holy bull of Shiv. He has taken the best of a
basket<br>
 of onions already, this morn; and forsooth, I must fill thy
bowl.<br>
 He comes here again.'</p>

<p>The huge, mouse-coloured Brahmini bull of the ward was<br>
 shouldering his way through the many-coloured crowd, a
stolen<br>
 plantain hanging out of his mouth. He headed straight for
the<br>
 shop, well knowing his privileges as a sacred beast, lowered
his<br>
 head, and puffed heavily along the line of baskets ere making
his<br>
 choice. Up flew Kim's hard little heel and caught him on his<br>
 moist blue nose. He snorted indignantly, and walked away
across<br>
 the tram-rails, his hump quivering with rage.</p>

<p>'See! I have saved more than the bowl will cost thrice over.
Now,<br>
 mother, a little rice and some dried fish atop - yes, and
some<br>
 vegetable curry.'</p>

<p>A growl came out of the back of the shop, where a man lay.</p>

<p>'He drove away the bull,' said the woman in an undertone. 'It
is<br>
 good to give to the poor.' She took the bowl and returned it
full<br>
 of hot rice.</p>

<p>'But my yogi is not a cow,' said Kim gravely, making a hole
with<br>
 his fingers in the top of the mound. 'A little curry is good,
and<br>
 a fried cake, and a morsel of conserve would please him, I<br>
 think.'</p>

<p>'It is a hole as big as thy head,' said the woman fretfully.
But<br>
 she filled it, none the less, with good, steaming vegetable<br>
 curry, clapped a fried cake atop, and a morsel of clarified<br>
 butter on the cake, dabbed a lump of sour tamarind conserve
at<br>
 the side; and Kim looked at the load lovingly.</p>

<p>'That is good. When I am in the bazar the bull shall not come
to<br>
 this house. He is a bold beggar-man.'</p>

<p>'And thou?' laughed the woman. 'But speak well of bulls.
Hast<br>
 thou not told me that some day a Red Bull will come out of a<br>
 field to help thee? Now hold all straight and ask for the
holy<br>
 man's blessing upon me. Perhaps, too, he knows a cure for my<br>
 daughter's -sore eyes. Ask. him that also, O thou Little
Friend<br>
 of all the World.'</p>

<p>But Kim had danced off ere the end of the sentence,
dodging<br>
 pariah dogs and hungry acquaintances.</p>

<p>'Thus do we beg who know the way of it,' said he proudly to
the<br>
 lama, who opened his eyes at the contents of the bowl. 'Eat
now<br>
 and - I will eat with thee. Ohe, bhisti!' he called to the
water-<br>
 carrier, sluicing the crotons by the Museum. 'Give water here.
We<br>
 men are thirsty.'</p>

<p>'We men!' said the bhisti, laughing. 'Is one skinful enough
for<br>
 such a pair? Drink, then, in the name of the Compassionate.'</p>

<p>He loosed a thin stream into Kim's hands, who drank
nativefasion;<br>
 but the lama must needs pull out a cup from his
inexhaustible<br>
 upper draperies and drink ceremonially.</p>

<p>'Pardesi [a foreigner],' Kim explained, as the old man
delivered<br>
 in an unknown tongue what was evidently a blessing.</p>

<p>They ate together in great content, clearing the
beggingbowl.<br>
 Then the lama took snuff from a portentous wooden
snuff-gourd,<br>
 fingered his rosary awhile, and so dropped into the easy sleep
of<br>
 age, as the shadow of Zam-Zammah grew long.</p>

<p>Kim loafed over to the nearest tobacco-seller, a rather
lively<br>
 young Mohammedan woman, and begged a rank cigar of the brand
that<br>
 they sell to students of the Punjab University who copy
English<br>
 customs. Then he smoked and thought, knees to chin, under
the<br>
 belly of the gun, and the outcome of his thoughts was a
sudden<br>
 and stealthy departure in the direction of Nila Ram's
timber-<br>
 yard.</p>

<p>The lama did not wake till the evening life of the city had
begun<br>
 with lamp-lighting and the return of white-robed clerks and<br>
 subordinates from the Government offices. He stared dizzily
in<br>
 all directions, but none looked at him save a Hindu urchin in
a<br>
 dirty turban and Isabella-coloured clothes. Suddenly he bowed
his<br>
 head on his knees and wailed.</p>

<p>'What is this?' said the boy, standing before him. 'Hast
thou<br>
 been robbed?'</p>

<p>'It is my new chela [disciple] that is gone away from me, and
I<br>
 know not where he is.'</p>

<p>'And what like of man was thy disciple?'</p>

<p>'It was a boy who came to me in place of him who died, on
account<br>
 of the merit which I had gained when I bowed before the Law<br>
 within there.' He pointed towards the Museum. 'He came upon me
to<br>
 show me a road which I had lost. He led me into the Wonder
House,<br>
 and by his talk emboldened me to speak to the Keeper of the<br>
 Images, so that I was cheered and made strong. And when I
was<br>
 faint with hunger he begged for me, as would a chela for his<br>
 teacher. Suddenly was he sent. Suddenly has he gone away. It
was<br>
 in my mind to have taught him the Law upon the road to
Benares.'</p>

<p>Kim stood amazed at this, because he had overheard the talk
in<br>
 the Museum, and knew that the old man was speaking the
truth,<br>
 which is a thing a native on the road seldom presents to a<br>
 stranger.</p>

<p>'But I see now that he was but sent for a purpose. By this I
know<br>
 that I shall find a certain River for which I seek.'</p>

<p>'The River of the Arrow?' said Kim, with a superior smile.</p>

<p>'Is this yet another Sending?' cried the lama. 'To none have
I<br>
 spoken of my search, save to the Priest of the Images. Who
art<br>
 thou?'</p>

<p>'Thy chela,' said Kim simply, sitting on his heels. 'I have
never<br>
 seen anyone like to thee in all this my life. I go with thee
to<br>
 Benares. And, too, I think that so old a man as thou,
speaking<br>
 the truth to chance-met people at dusk, is in great need of
a<br>
 disciple.'</p>

<p>'But the River - the River of the Arrow?'</p>

<p>'Oh, that I heard when thou wast speaking to the- Englishman.
I<br>
 lay against the door.'</p>

<p>The lama sighed. 'I thought thou hadst been a guide
permitted.<br>
 Such things fall sometimes - but I am not worthy. Thou dost
not,<br>
 then, know the River?'</p>

<p>'Not U Kim laughed uneasily. 'I go to look for - for a bull
a<br>
 Red. Bull on a green field who shall help me.' Boylike, if
an<br>
 acquaintance had a scheme, Kim was quite ready with one of
his<br>
 own; and,</p>

<p>boylike, he had really thought for as much as twenty minutes
at a<br>
 time of his father's prophecy.</p>

<p>'To what, child?' said the lama.</p>

<p>'God knows, but so my father told me'. I heard thy talk in
the<br>
 Wonder House of all those new strange places in the Hills, and
if<br>
 one so old and so little - so used to truth-telling - may go
out<br>
 for the small matter of a river, it seemed to me that I too
must<br>
 go a-travelling. If it is our fate to find those things we
shall<br>
 find them - thou, thy River; and I, my Bull, and the Strong<br>
 Pillars and some other matters that I forget.'</p>

<p>'It is not pillars but a Wheel from which I would be free,'
said<br>
 the lama.</p>

<p>'That is all one. Perhaps they will make me a king,' said
Kim,<br>
 serenely prepared for anything.</p>

<p>'I will teach thee other and better desires upon the road,'
the<br>
 lama replied in the voice of authority. 'Let us go to
Benares.'</p>

<p>'Not by night. Thieves are abroad. Wait till the day.'</p>

<p>'But there is no place to sleep.' The old man was used to
the<br>
 order of his monastery, and though he slept on the ground, as
the<br>
 Rule decrees, preferred a decency in these things.</p>

<p>'We shall get good lodging at the Kashmir Serai,' said
Kim,<br>
 laughing at his perplexity. 'I have a friend there. Come!'</p>

<p>The hot and crowded bazars blazed with light as they made
their<br>
 way through the press of all the races in Upper India, and
the<br>
 lama mooned through it like a man in a dream. It was his
first<br>
 experience of a large manufacturing city, and the crowded
tram-<br>
 car with its continually squealing brakes frightened him.
Half<br>
 pushed, half towed, he arrived at the high gate of the
Kashmir<br>
 Serai: that huge open square over against the railway
station,<br>
 surrounded with arched cloisters, where the camel and horse<br>
 caravans put up on their return from Central Asia. Here were
all<br>
 manner of Northern folk, tending tethered ponies and
kneeling<br>
 camels; loading and unloading bales and bundles; drawing
water<br>
 for the evening meal at the creaking well-windlasses; piling<br>
 grass before the shrieking, wild-eyed stallions; cuffing the<br>
 surly caravan dogs; paying off camel-drivers; taking on new<br>
 grooms; swearing, shouting, arguing, and chaffering in the
packed<br>
 square. The cloisters, reached by three or four masonry
steps,<br>
 made a haven of refuge around this turbulent sea. Most of
them<br>
 were rented to traders, as we rent the arches of a viaduct;
the<br>
 space between pillar and pillar being bricked or boarded off
into<br>
 rooms, which were guarded by heavy wooden doors and cumbrous<br>
 native padlocks. Locked doors showed that the owner was away,
and<br>
 a few rude - sometimes very rude - chalk or paint scratches
told<br>
 where he had gone. Thus: 'Lutuf Ullah is gone to Kurdistan.'<br>
 Below, in coarse verse: 'O Allah, who sufferest lice to live
on<br>
 the coat of a Kabuli, why hast thou allowed this louse Lutuf
to<br>
 live so long?'</p>

<br>
Kim, fending the lama between excited men and excited beasts,
<br>
sidled along the cloisters to the far end, nearest the -railway
<br>
station, where Mahbub Ali, the horse-trader, lived when he came
<br>
in from that mysterious land beyond the Passes of the North.

<p>Kim had had many dealings with Mahbub in his little life,<br>
 especially between his tenth and his thirteenth year - and
the<br>
 big burly Afghan, his beard dyed scarlet with lime (for he
was<br>
 elderly and did not wish his grey hairs to show), knew the
boy's<br>
 value as a gossip. Sometimes he would tell Kim to watch a man
who<br>
 had nothing whatever to do with horses: to follow him for
one<br>
 whole day and report every soul with whom he talked. Kim
would<br>
 deliver himself of his tale at evening, and Mahbub would
listen<br>
 without a word or gesture. It was intrigue of some kind, Kim<br>
 knew; but its worth lay in saying nothing whatever to anyone<br>
 except Mahbub, who gave him beautiful meals all hot from the<br>
 cookshop at the head of the serai, and once as much as eight<br>
 annas in money.</p>

<p>'He is here,' said Kim, hitting a bad-tempered camel on the
nose.<br>
 'Ohe. Mahbub Ali!' He halted at a dark arch and slipped
behind<br>
 the bewildered lama.</p>

<p>The horse-trader, his deep, embroidered Bokhariot belt
unloosed,<br>
 was lying on a pair of silk carpet saddle-bags, pulling lazily
at<br>
 an immense silver hookah. He turned his head very slightly at
the<br>
 cry; and seeing only the tall silent figure, chuckled in his<br>
 deep. chest.</p>

<p>'Allah! A lama! A Red Lama! It is far from Lahore to the
Passes.<br>
 What dost thou do here?'</p>

<p>The lama held out the begging-bowl mechanically.</p>

<p>'God's curse on all unbelievers!' said Mahbub. 'I do not give
to<br>
 a lousy Tibetan; but ask my Baltis over yonder behind the
camels.<br>
 They may value your blessings. Oh, horseboys, here is a<br>
 countryman of yours. See if he be hungry.'</p>

<p>A shaven, crouching Balti, who had come down with the horses,
and<br>
 who was nominally some sort of degraded Buddhist, fawned upon
the<br>
 priest, and in thick gutturals besought the Holy One to sit
at<br>
 the horseboys' fire.</p>

<p>'Go!' said Kim, pushing him lightly, and the lama strode
away,<br>
 leaving Kim at the edge of the cloister.</p>

<p>'Go!' said Mahbub Ali, returning to his hookah. 'Little
Hindu,<br>
 run away. God's curse on all unbelievers! Beg from those of
my<br>
 tail who are of thy faith.'</p>

<p>'Maharaj,' whined Kim, using the Hindu form of address,
and<br>
 thoroughly enjoying the situation; 'my father is dead - my
mother<br>
 is dead - my stomach is empty.'</p>

<p>'Beg from my men among the horses, I say. There must be
some<br>
 Hindus in my tall.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Mahbub Ali, but am I a Hindu?' said Kim in English.</p>

<p>The trader gave no sign of astonishment, but looked under
shaggy<br>
 eyebrows.</p>

<p>'Little Friend of all the World,' said he, 'what is this?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. I am now that holy man's disciple; and we go a<br>
 pilgrimage together - to Benares, he says. He is quite mad, and
I<br>
 am tired of Lahore city. I wish new air and water.'</p>

<p>'But for whom dost thou work? Why come to me?' The voice
was<br>
 harsh with suspicion.</p>

<p>'To whom else should I come? I have no money. It is not good
to<br>
 go about without money. Thou wilt sell many horses to the<br>
 officers. They are very fine horses, these new ones: I have
seen<br>
 them. Give me a rupee, Mahbub Ali, and when I come to my wealth
I<br>
 will give thee a bond and pay.'</p>

<p>'Um!' said Mahbub Ali, thinking swiftly. 'Thou hast never
before<br>
 lied to me. Call that lama - stand back in the dark.'</p>

<p>'Oh, our tales will agree,' said Kim, laughing.</p>

<p>'We go to Benares,' said the lama, as soon as he understood
the<br>
 drift of Mahbub Ali's questions. 'The boy and I, I go to seek
for<br>
 a certain River.'</p>

<p>'Maybe - but the boy?'</p>

<p>'He is my disciple. He was sent, I think, to guide me to
that<br>
 River. Sitting under a. gun was I when he came suddenly.
Such<br>
 things have befallen the fortunate to whom guidance was
allowed.<br>
 But I remember now, he said he was of this world - a Hindu.'</p>

<p>'And his name?'</p>

<p>'That I did not ask. Is he not my disciple?'</p>

<p>'His country - his race - his village? Mussalman - Sikh Hindu
-<br>
 Jain - low caste or high?'</p>

<p>'Why should I ask? There is neither high nor low in the
Middle<br>
 Way. If he is my chela - does - will - can anyone take him
from<br>
 me? for, look you, without him I shall not find my River.'
He<br>
 wagged his head solemnly.</p>

<p>'None shall take him from thee. Go, sit among my Baltis,'
said<br>
 Mahbub Ali, and the lama drifted off, soothed by the
promise.</p>

<p>'Is he not quite mad?' said Kim, coming forward to the
light<br>
 again. 'Why should I lie to thee, Hajji?'</p>

<p>Mahbub puffed his hookah in silence. Then he began, almost<br>
 whispering: 'Umballa is on the road to Benares - if indeed ye
two<br>
 go there.'</p>

<p>'Tck! Tck! I tell thee he does not know how to lie - as we
two<br>
 know.'</p>

<p>'And if thou wilt carry a message for me as far as Umballa,
I<br>
 will give thee money. It concerns a horse - a white stallion<br>
 which I have sold to an officer upon the last time I
returned<br>
 from the Passes. But then - stand nearer and hold up hands
as<br>
 begging -the pedigree of the white stallion was not fully<br>
 established, and that officer, who is now at Umballa, bade
me<br>
 make it clear.' (Mahbub here described the horse and the<br>
 appearance of the officer.) 'So the message to that officer
will<br>
 be: "The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established."
By<br>
 this will he know that thou comest from me. He will then say<br>
 "What proof hast thou?" and thou wilt answer: "Mahbub Ali
has<br>
 given me the proof."'</p>

<p>'And all for the sake of a white stallion,' said Kim, with
a<br>
 giggle, his eyes aflame.</p>

<p>'That pedigree I will give thee now - in my own fashion and
some<br>
 hard words as well.' A shadow passed behind Kim, and a
feeding<br>
 camel. Mahbub Ali raised his voice.</p>

<p>'Allah! Art thou the only beggar in the city? Thy mother is
dead.<br>
 Thy father is dead. So is it with all of them. Well, well -
'</p>

<p>He turned as feeling on the floor beside him and tossed a flap
of<br>
 soft, greasy Mussalman bread to the boy. 'Go and lie down
among<br>
 my horseboys for tonight - thou and the lama. Tomorrow I may
give<br>
 thee service.'</p>

<p>Kim slunk away, his teeth in the bread, and, as he expected,
he<br>
 found a small wad of folded tissue-paper wrapped in oilskin,
with<br>
 three silver rupees - enormous largesse. He smiled and
thrust<br>
 money and paper into his leather amulet-case. The lama,<br>
 sumptuously fed by Mahbub's Baltis, was already asleep in a<br>
 corner of one of the stalls. Kim lay down beside him and
laughed.<br>
 He knew he had rendered a service to Mahbub Ali, and not for
one<br>
 little minute did he believe the tale of the stallion's
pedigree.</p>

<p>But Kim did not suspect that Mahbub Ali, known as one of the
best<br>
 horse-dealers in the Punjab, a wealthy and enterprising
trader,<br>
 whose caravans penetrated far and far into the Back of
Beyond,<br>
 was registered in one of the locked books of the Indian
Survey<br>
 Department as C25 IB. Twice or thrice yearly C25 would send in
a<br>
 little story, baldly told but most interesting, and generally
-<br>
 it was checked by the statements of R17 and M4 - quite true.
It<br>
 concerned all manner of out-of-the-way mountain
principalities,<br>
 explorers of nationalities other than English, and the guntrade
-<br>
 was, in brief, a small portion of that vast mass of
'information<br>
 received' on which the Indian Government acts. But,
recently,<br>
 five confederated Kings, who had no business to confederate,
had<br>
 been informed by a kindly Northern Power that there was a
leakage<br>
 of news from their territories into British India. So those<br>
 Kings' Prime Ministers were seriously annoyed and took
steps,<br>
 after the Oriental fashion. They suspected, among many
others,<br>
 the bullying, red-bearded horsedealer whose caravans
ploughed<br>
 through their fastnesses belly-deep in snow. At least, his<br>
 caravan that season had been ambushed and shot at twice on
the<br>
 way down, when Mahbub's men accounted for three strange
ruffians<br>
 who might, or might not, have been hired for the job.
Therefore<br>
 Mahbub had avoided halting at the insalubrious city of
Peshawur,<br>
 and had come through without stop to Lahore, where, knowing
his<br>
 country-people, he anticipated curious developments.</p>

<br>
And there was that on Mahbub Ali which he did not wish to keep an
<br>
hour longer than was necessary - a wad of closely folded
tissue-<br>
paper, wrapped in oilskin - an impersonal, unaddressed statement,
<br>
with five microscopic pin-holes in one corner, that most <br>
scandalously betrayed the five confederated Kings, the <br>
sympathetic Northern Power, a Hindu banker in Peshawur, a firm of
<br>
gun-makers in Belgium, and an important, semi-independent <br>
Mohammedan ruler to the south. This last was R17's work, which
<br>
Mahbub had picked up beyond the Dora Pass and was carrying in for
<br>
R17, who, owing to circumstances over which he had no control,
<br>
could not leave his post of observation. Dynamite was milky and
<br>
innocuous beside that report Of C25; and even an Oriental, with
<br>
an Oriental's views of the value of time, could see that the <br>
sooner it was in the proper hands the better. Mahbub had no <br>
particular desire to die by violence, because two or three family
<br>
blood-feuds across the Border hung unfinished on his hands, and
<br>
when these scores were cleared he intended to settle down as a
<br>
more or less virtuous citizen. He had never passed the serai gate
<br>
since his arrival two days ago, but had been ostentatious in <br>
sending telegrams to Bombay, where he banked some of his money;
<br>
to Delhi, where a sub-partner of his own clan was selling horses
<br>
to the agent of a Rajputana state; and to Umballa, where an <br>
Englishman was excitedly demanding the pedigree of a white <br>
stallion. The public letter-writer, who knew English, composed
<br>
excellent telegrams, such as: 'Creighton, Laurel Bank, Umballa.
<br>
Horse is Arabian as already advised. Sorrowful delayed pedigree
<br>
which am translating.' And later to the same address: 'Much <br>
sorrowful delay. Will forward pedigree.' To his sub-partner at
<br>
Delhi he wired: 'Lutuf Ullah. Have wired two thousand rupees your
<br>
credit Luchman Narain's bank-' This was entirely in the way of
<br>
trade, but every one of those telegrams was discussed and re-<br>
discussed, by parties who conceived themselves to be interested,
<br>
before they went over to the railway station in charge of a <br>
foolish Balti, who allowed all sorts of people to read them on
<br>
the road.

<p>When, in Mahbub's own picturesque language, he had muddied
the<br>
 wells of inquiry with the stick of precaution, Kim had dropped
on<br>
 him, sent from Heaven; and, being as prompt as he was<br>
 unscrupulous, Mahbub Ali used to taking all sorts of gusty<br>
 chances, pressed him into service on the spot.</p>

<p>A wandering lama with a low-caste boy-servant might attract
a<br>
 moment's interest as they wandered about India, the land of<br>
 pilgrims; but no one would suspect them or, what was more to
the<br>
 point, rob.</p>

<p>He called for a new light-ball to his hookah, and considered
the<br>
 case. If the worst came to the worst, and the boy came to
harm,<br>
 the paper would incriminate nobody. And he would go up to
Umballa<br>
 leisurely and - at a certain risk of exciting fresh suspicion
-<br>
 repeat his tale by word of mouth to the people concerned.</p>

<p>But R17's report was the kernel of the whole affair, and it
would<br>
 be distinctly inconvenient if that failed to come to hand.<br>
 However, God was great, and Mahbub Ali felt he had done all
he<br>
 could for the time being. Kim was the one soul in the world
who<br>
 had never told him a lie. That would have been a fatal blot
on<br>
 Kim's character if Mahbub had not known that to others, for
his<br>
 own ends or Mahbub's business, Kim could lie like an
Oriental.</p>

<p>Then Mahbub Ali rolled across the serai to the Gate of the<br>
 Harpies who paint their eyes and trap the stranger, and was
at<br>
 some pains to call on the one girl who, he had reason to
believe,<br>
 was a particular friend of a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit who
had<br>
 waylaid his simple Balti in the matter of the telegrams. It
was<br>
 an utterly foolish thing to do; because they fell to
drinking<br>
 perfumed brandy against the Law of the Prophet, and Mahbub
grew<br>
 wonderfully drunk, and the gates of his mouth were loosened,
and<br>
 he pursued the Flower of Delight with the feet of
intoxication<br>
 till he fell flat among the cushions, where the Flower of<br>
 Delight, aided by a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit, searched
him<br>
 from head to foot most thoroughly.</p>

<p>About the same hour Kim heard soft feet in Mahbub's
deserted<br>
 stall. The horse-trader, curiously enough, had left his door<br>
 unlocked, and his men were busy celebrating their return to
India<br>
 with a whole sheep of Mahbub's bounty. A sleek young
gentleman<br>
 from Delhi, armed with a bunch of keys which the Flower had<br>
 unshackled from the senseless one's belt, went through every<br>
 single box, bundle, mat, and saddle-bag in Mahbub's
possession<br>
 even more systematically than the Flower and the pundit were<br>
 searching the owner.</p>

<p>'And I think.' said the Flower scornfully an hour later,
one<br>
 rounded elbow on the snoring carcass, 'that he is no more than
a<br>
 pig of an Afghan horse-dealer, with no thought except women
and<br>
 horses. Moreover, he may have sent it away by now - if ever
there<br>
 were such a thing.'</p>

<p>'Nay - in a matter touching Five Kings it would be next his
black<br>
 heart,' said the pundit. 'Was there nothing?'</p>

<p>The Delhi man laughed and resettled his turban as he entered.
'I<br>
 searched between the soles of his slippers as the Flower
searched<br>
 his clothes. This is not the man but another. I leave little<br>
 unseen.'</p>

<p>'They did not say he was the very man,' said the pundit<br>
 thoughtfully. 'They said, "Look if he be the man, since our<br>
 counsels are troubled."'</p>

<p>'That North country is full of horse-dealers as an old coat
of<br>
 lice. There is Sikandar Khan, Nur Ali Beg, and Farrukh Shah
all<br>
 heads of kafilas [caravans] - who deal there,' said the
Flower.</p>

<p>'They have not yet come in,' said the pundit. 'Thou must
ensnare<br>
 them later.'</p>

<p>Phew!' said the Flower with deep disgust, rolling Mahbub's
head<br>
 from her lap. 'I earn my money. Farrukh Shah is a bear, Ali Beg
a<br>
 swashbuckler, and old Sikandar Khan - yaie! Go! I sleep now.
This<br>
 swine will not stir till dawn.'</p>

<p>When Mahbub woke, the Flower talked to him severely on the sin
of<br>
 drunkenness. Asiatics do not wink when they have outmanoeuvred
an<br>
 enemy, but as Mahbub Ali cleared his throat, tightened his
belt,<br>
 and staggered forth under the early morning stars, he came
very<br>
 near to it.</p>

<p>'What a colt's trick!' said he to himself 'As if every girl
in<br>
 Peshawur did not use it! But 'twas prettily done. Now God He<br>
 knows how many more there be upon the Road who have orders
to<br>
 test me - perhaps with the knife. So it stands that the boy
must<br>
 go to Umballa - and by rail -for the writing is something<br>
 urgent. I abide here, following the Flower and drinking wine
as<br>
 an Afghan coper should.'</p>

<p>He halted at the stall next but one to his own. His men lay
there<br>
 heavy with sleep. There was no sign of Kim or the lama.</p>

<p>'Up! He stirred a sleeper. 'Whither went those who lay here
last<br>
 even - the lama and the boy? Is aught missing?'</p>

<p>'Nay,' grunted the man, 'the old madman rose at second
cockcrow<br>
 saying he would go to Benares, and the young one led him
away.'</p>

<p>'The curse of Allah on all unbelievers!' said Mahbub
heartily,<br>
 and climbed into his own stall, growling in his beard.</p>

<p>But it was Kim who had wakened the lama - Kim with one eye
laid<br>
 against a knot-hole in the planking, who had seen the Delhi
man's<br>
 search through the boxes. This was no common thief that
turned<br>
 over letters, bills, and saddles - no mere burglar who ran a<br>
 little knife sideways into the soles of Mahbub's slippers,
or<br>
 picked the seams of the saddle-bags so deftly. At first Kim
had<br>
 been minded to give the alarm - the long-drawn cho-or
-choor!<br>
 [thief! thief!] that sets the serai ablaze of nights; but he<br>
 looked more carefully, and, hand on amulet, drew his own<br>
 conclusions.</p>

<p>'It must be the pedigree of that made-up horse-lie,' said
he,<br>
 'the thing that I carry to Umballa. Better that we go now.
Those<br>
 who search bags with knives may presently search bellies
with<br>
 knives. Surely there is a woman behind this. Hai! Hai! in a<br>
 whisper to the light-sleeping old man. 'Come. It is time -
time<br>
 to go to Benares.'</p>

<p>The lama rose obediently, and they passed out of the serai
like<br>
 shadows.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

 And whoso will, from Pride released;<br>

 About him at Kamakura.</p>

<p>Buddha at Kamakura.</p>

<p><br>
 They entered the fort-like railway station, black in the end
of<br>
 night; the electrics sizzling over the goods-yard where they<br>
 handle the heavy Northern grain-traffic.</p>

<p>'This is the work of devils!' said the lama, recoiling from
the<br>
 hollow echoing darkness, the glimmer of rails between the
masonry<br>
 platforms, and the maze of girders above. He stood in a
gigantic<br>
 stone hall paved, it seemed, with the sheeted dead
third-class<br>
 passengers who had taken their tickets overnight and were<br>
 sleeping in the waiting-rooms. All hours of the twenty-four
are<br>
 alike to Orientals, and their passenger traffic is regulated<br>
 accordingly.</p>

<p>'This is where the fire-carriages come. One stands behind
that<br>
 hole' -Kim pointed to the ticket-office - 'who will give thee
a<br>
 paper to take thee to Umballa.'</p>

<p>'But we go to Benares,' he replied petulantly.</p>

<p>'All one. Benares then. Quick: she comes!'</p>

<p>'Take thou the purse.'</p>

<p>The lama, not so well used to trains as he had pretended,
started<br>
 as the 3.25a.m. south-bound roared in. The sleepers sprang
to<br>
 life, and the station filled with clamour and shoutings, cries
of<br>
 water and sweetmeat vendors, shouts of native policemen, and<br>
 shrill yells of women gathering up their baskets, their
families,<br>
 and their husbands.</p>

<p>'It is the train - only the te-rain. It will not come
here.<br>
 Wait!' Amazed at the lama's immense- simplicity (he had
handed<br>
 him a small bag full of rupees), Kim asked and paid for a
ticket<br>
 to Umballa. A sleepy clerk grunted and flung out a ticket to
the<br>
 next station, just six miles distant.</p>

<p>'Nay,' said Kim, scanning it with a grin. 'This may serve
for<br>
 farmers, but I live in the city of Lahore. It was cleverly
done,<br>
 Babu. Now give the ticket to Umballa.'</p>

<p>The Babu scowled and dealt the proper ticket.</p>

<p>'Now another to Amritzar,' said Kim, who had no notion of<br>
 spending Mahbub Ali's money on anything so crude as a paid
ride<br>
 to Umballa. 'The price is so much. The small money in return
is<br>
 just so much. I know the ways of the te-rain ... Never did
yogi<br>
 need chela as thou dost,' he went on merrily to the
bewildered<br>
 lama. 'They would have flung thee out at Mian Mir but for
me.<br>
 This way! Come!' He returned the money, keeping only one anna
in<br>
 each rupee of the price of the Umballa ticket as his commission
-<br>
 the immemorial commission of Asia.</p>

<p>The lama jibbed at the open door of a crowded third-class<br>
 carriage. 'Were it not better to walk?' said he weakly.</p>

<p>A burly Sikh artisan thrust forth his bearded head. 'Is he<br>
 afraid? Do not be afraid. I remember the time when I was
afraid<br>
 of the te-rain. Enter! This thing is the work of the
Government.'</p>

<p>'I do not fear,' said the lama. 'Have ye room within for
two?'</p>

<p>'There is no room even for a mouse,' shrilled the wife of a
well-<br>
 to-do cultivator - a Hindu Jat from the rich Jullundur,
district.<br>
 Our night trains are not as well looked after as the day
ones,<br>
 where the sexes are very strictly kept to separate
carriages.</p>

<p>'Oh, mother of my son, we can make space,' said the
blueturbaned<br>
 husband. 'Pick up the child. It is a holy man, see'st thou?'</p>

<p>'And my lap full of seventy times seven bundles! Why not bid
him<br>
 sit on my knee, Shameless? But men are ever thus!' She
looked<br>
 round for approval. An Amritzar courtesan near the window
sniffed<br>
 behind her head drapery.</p>

<p>'Enter! Enter!' cried a fat Hindu money-lender, his folded<br>
 account-book in a cloth under his arm. With an oily smirk: 'It
is<br>
 well to be kind to the poor.'</p>

<p>'Ay, at seven per cent a month with a mortgage on the
unborn<br>
 calf,' said a young Dogra, soldier going south on leave; and
they<br>
 all laughed.</p>

<p>'Will it travel to Benares?' said the lama.</p>

<p>'Assuredly. Else why should we come? Enter, or we are
left,'<br>
 cried Kim.</p>

<p>'See!' shrilled the Amritzar girl. 'He has never entered a
train.<br>
 Oh, see!'</p>

<p>'Nay, help,' said the cultivator, putting out a large brown
hand<br>
 and hauling him in. 'Thus is it done, father.'</p>

<p>'But - but - I sit on the floor. It is against the Rule to sit
on<br>
 a bench,' said the lama. 'Moreover, it cramps me.'</p>

<p>'I say,' began the money-lender, pursing his lips, 'that there
is<br>
 not one rule of right living which these te-rains do not cause
as<br>
 to break. We sit, for example, side by side with all castes
and<br>
 peoples.'</p>

<p>'Yea, and with most outrageously shameless ones,' said the
wife,<br>
 scowling at the Amritzar girl making eyes at the young
sepoy.</p>

<p>'I said we might have gone by cart along the road,' said
the<br>
 husband, 'and thus have saved some money.'</p>

<p>'Yes - and spent twice over what we saved on food by the
way.<br>
 That was talked out ten thousand times.'</p>

<p>'Ay, by ten thousand tongues,' grunted he.</p>

<p>'The Gods help us poor women if we may not speak. Oho! He is
of<br>
 that sort which may not look at or reply to a woman.' For
the<br>
 lama, constrained by his Rule, took not the faintest notice
of<br>
 her. 'And his disciple is like him?'</p>

<p>'Nay, mother,' said Kim most promptly. 'Not when the woman
is<br>
 well-looking and above all charitable to the hungry.'</p>

<p>'A beggar's answer,' said the Sikh, laughing. 'Thou hast
brought<br>
 it on thyself, sister!' Kim's hands were crooked in
supplication.</p>

<p>'And whither goest thou?' said the woman, handing him the half
of<br>
 a cake from a greasy package.</p>

<p>'Even to Benares.'</p>

<p>'Jugglers belike?' the young soldier suggested. 'Have ye
any<br>
 tricks to pass the time? Why does not that yellow man
answer?'</p>

<p><br>
 'Because,' said Kim stoutly, 'he is holy, and thinks upon
matters<br>
 hidden from thee.'</p>

<p>'That may be well. We of the Ludhiana Sikhs' - he rolled it
out<br>
 sonorously -'do not trouble our heads with doctrine. We
fight.'</p>

<p>'My sister's brother's son is naik (corporal] in that
regiment,'<br>
 said the Sikh craftsman quietly. 'There are also some Dogra<br>
 companies there.' The soldier glared, for a Dogra is of
other<br>
 caste than a Sikh, and the banker tittered.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br>
 'They are all one to me, ' said the Amritzar girl.</p>

<p>'That we believe,' snorted the cultivator's wife
malignantly.</p>

<p>'Nay, but all who serve the Sirkar with weapons in their
hands<br>
 are, as it were, one brotherhood. There is one brotherhood of
the<br>
 caste, but beyond that again' - she looked round timidly
-'the<br>
 bond of the Pulton - the Regiment -eh?'</p>

<p>'My brother is in a Jat regiment,' said the cultivator.
'Dogras<br>
 be good men.'</p>

<p>'Thy Sikhs at least were of that opinion,' said the soldier,
with<br>
 a scowl at the placid old man in the corner. 'Thy Sikhs
thought<br>
 so when our two companies came to help them at the Pirzai
Kotal<br>
 in the face of eight Afridi standards on the ridge not three<br>
 months gone.'</p>

<p>He told the story of a Border action in which the Dogra
companies<br>
 of the Ludhiana Sikhs had acquitted themselves well. The
Amritzar<br>
 girl smiled; for she knew the talc was to win her approval.</p>

<p>'Alas!' said the cultivator's wife at the end. 'So their
villages<br>
 were burnt and their little children made homeless?'</p>

<p>'They had marked our dead. They paid a great payment after we
of<br>
 the Sikhs had schooled them. So it was. Is this Amritzar?'</p>

<p>'Ay, and here they cut our tickets,' said the banker, fumbling
at<br>
 his belt.</p>

<p>The lamps were paling in the dawn when the half-caste guard
came<br>
 round. Ticket-collecting is a slow business in the East,
where<br>
 people secrete their tickets in all sorts of curious places.
Kim<br>
 produced his and was told to get out.</p>

<p>'But I go to Umballa,' he protested. 'I go with this holy
man.'</p>

<p>'Thou canst go to Jehannum for aught I care. This ticket is
only</p>

<p>Kim burst into a flood of tears, protesting that the lama was
his<br>
 father and his mother, that he was the prop of the lama's<br>
 declining years, and that the lama would die without his
care.<br>
 All the carriage bade the guard be merciful - the banker was<br>
 specially eloquent here - but the guard hauled Kim on to the<br>
 platform. The lama blinked - he could not overtake the
situation<br>
 and Kim lifted up his voice and wept outside the carriage<br>
 window.</p>

<p>'I am very poor. My father is dead - my mother is dead. O<br>
 charitable ones, if I am left here, who shall tend that old
man?'</p>

<p>'What - what is this?' the lama repeated. 'He must go to
Benares.<br>
 He must come with me. He is my chela. If there is money to
be<br>
 paid -'</p>

<p>'Oh, be silent,' whispered Kim; 'are we Rajahs to throw away
good<br>
 silver when the world is so charitable?'</p>

<p>The Amritzar girl stepped out with her bundles, and it was on
her<br>
 that Kim kept his watchful eye. Ladies of that persuasion,
he<br>
 knew, were generous.</p>

<p>'A ticket - a little tikkut to Umballa - O Breaker of
Hearts!'<br>
 She laughed. 'Hast thou no charity?'</p>

<p>'Does the holy man come from the North'</p>

<p>'From far and far in the North he comes,' cried Kim. 'From
among<br>
 the hills.'</p>

<p>'There is snow among the pine-trees in the North - in the
hills<br>
 there is snow. My mother was from Kulu. Get thee a ticket.
Ask<br>
 him for a blessing.'</p>

<p>'Ten thousand blessings,' shrilled Kim. 'O Holy One, a woman
has<br>
 given us in charity so that I can come with thee - a woman with
a<br>
 golden heart. I run for the tikkut.'</p>

<p>The girl looked up at the lama, who had mechanically followed
Kim<br>
 to the platform. He bowed his head that he might not see her,
and<br>
 muttered in Tibetan as she passed on with the crowd.</p>

<p>'Light come - light go,' said the cultivator's wife
viciously.</p>

<p>'She has acquired merit,' returned the lama. 'Beyond doubt it
was<br>
 a nun.'</p>

<p>'There be ten thousand such nuns in Amritzar alone.
Return,</p>

<p>old man, or the te-rain may depart without thee,' cried
the<br>
 banker.</p>

<p>'Not only was it sufficient for the ticket, but for a little
food<br>
 also, ' said Kim, leaping to his place. 'Now eat, Holy One.
Look.<br>
 Day comes!'</p>

<p>Golden, rose, saffron, and pink, the morning mists smoked
away<br>
 across the flat green levels. All the rich Punjab lay out in
the<br>
 splendour of the keen sun. The lama flinched a little as the<br>
 telegraph-posts swung by.</p>

<p>'Great is the speed of the te-rain,' said the banker, with
a<br>
 patronizing grin. 'We have gone farther since Lahore than
thou<br>
 couldst walk in two days: at even, we shall enter Umballa.'</p>

<p>'And that is still far from Benares,' said the lama
wearily,<br>
 mumbling over the cakes that Kim offered. They all unloosed
their<br>
 bundles and made their morning meal. Then the banker, the<br>
 cultivator, and the soldier prepared their pipes and wrapped
the<br>
 compartment in choking, acrid smoke, spitting and coughing
and<br>
 enjoying themselves. The Sikh and the cultivator's wife
chewed<br>
 pan; the lama took snuff and told his beads, while Kim,
cross-<br>
 legged, smiled over the comfort of a full stomach.</p>

<p>'What rivers have ye by Benares?' said the lama of a sudden
to<br>
 the carriage at large.</p>

<p>'We have Gunga,' returned the banker, when the little titter
had<br>
 subsided.</p>

<p>'What others?'</p>

<p>'What other than Gunga?'</p>

<p>'Nay, but in my mind was the thought of a certain River of<br>
 healing.'</p>

<p>'That is Gunga. Who bathes in her is made clean and goes to
the<br>
 Gods. Thrice have I made pilgrimage to Gunga.' He looked
round<br>
 proudly.</p>

<p>'There was need,' said the young sepoy drily, and the
travellers'<br>
 laugh turned against the banker.</p>

<p>'Clean - to return again to the Gods,' the lama muttered. 'And
to<br>
 go forth on the round of lives anew - still tied to the
Wheel.'<br>
 He shook his head testily. 'But maybe there is a mistake.
Who,<br>
 then, made Gunga in the beginning?'</p>

<p>'The Gods. Of what known faith art thou?' the banker said,<br>
 appalled.</p>

<p>'I follow the Law - the Most Excellent Law. So it was the
Gods<br>
 that made Gunga. What like of Gods were they?'</p>

<p>The carriage looked at him in amazement. It was
inconceivable<br>
 that anyone should be ignorant of Gunga.</p>

<p>'What - what is thy God?' said the money-lender at last.</p>

<p>'Hear!' said the lama, shifting the rosary to his hand.
'Hear:<br>
 for I speak of Him now! O people of Hind, listen!'</p>

<p>He began in Urdu the tale of the Lord Buddha, but, borne by
his<br>
 own thoughts, slid into Tibetan and long-droned texts from a<br>
 Chinese book of the Buddha's life. The gentle, tolerant folk<br>
 looked on reverently. All India is full of holy men
stammering<br>
 gospels in strange tongues; shaken and consumed in the fires
of<br>
 their own zeal; dreamers, babblers, and visionaries: as it
has<br>
 been from the beginning and will continue to the end.</p>

<p>'Um!' said the soldier of the Ludhiana Sikhs. 'There was a<br>
 Mohammedan regiment lay next to us at the Pirzai Kotal, and
a<br>
 priest of theirs - he was, as I remember, a naik - when the
fit<br>
 was on him, spake prophecies. But the mad all are in God's<br>
 keeping. His officers overlooked much in that man.'</p>

<p>The lama fell back on Urdu, remembering that he was in a
strange<br>
 land. 'Hear the tale of the Arrow which our Lord loosed from
the<br>
 bow,' he said.</p>

<p>This was much more to their taste, and they listened
curiously<br>
 while he told it. 'Now, O people of Hind, I go to seek that<br>
 River. Know ye aught that may guide me, for we be all men
and<br>
 women in evil case.'</p>

<p>'There is Gunga - and Gunga alone - who washes away sin.' ran
the<br>
 murmur round the carriage.</p>

<p>'Though past question we have good Gods Jullundur-way,' said
the<br>
 cultivator's wife, looking out of the window. 'See how they
have<br>
 blessed the crops.'</p>

<p>'To search every river in the Punjab is no small matter,'
said<br>
 her husband. 'For me, a stream that leaves good silt on my
land<br>
 suffices, and I thank Bhumia, the God of the Home-stead.' He<br>
 shrugged one knotted, bronzed shoulder.</p>

<p>'Think you our Lord came so far North?' said the lama, turning
to<br>
 Kim.</p>

<p>'It may be,' Kim replied soothingly, as he spat red pan-juice
on<br>
 the floor.</p>

<p>'The last of the Great Ones,' said the Sikh with authority,
'was<br>
 Sikander Julkarn [Alexander the Great]. He paved the streets
of<br>
 Jullundur and built a great tank near Umballa. That pavement<br>
 holds to this day; and the tank is there also. I never heard
of<br>
 thy God.'</p>

<p>'Let thy hair grow long and talk Punjabi,' said the young
soldier<br>
 jestingly to Kim, quoting a Northern proverb. 'That is all
that<br>
 makes a Sikh.' But he did not say this very loud.</p>

<p>The lama sighed and shrank into himself, a dingy, shapeless
mass.<br>
 In the pauses of their talk they could hear the low droning
_'Om<br>
 mane pudme hum! Om mane pudme hum!' - and the thick click of
the<br>
 wooden rosary beads.</p>

<p>'It irks me,' he said at last. 'The speed and the clatter irk
me.<br>
 Moreover, my chela, I think that maybe we have over-passed
that<br>
 River.'</p>

<p>'Peace, peace,' said Kim. 'Was not the River near Benares? We
are<br>
 yet far from the place.'</p>

<p>'But - if our Lord came North, it may be any one of these
little<br>
 ones that we have run across.'</p>

<p>'I do not know.'</p>

<p>'But thou wast sent to me - wast thou sent to me? - for the
merit<br>
 I had acquired over yonder at Such-zen. From beside the
cannon<br>
 didst thou come - bearing two faces -and two garbs.'</p>

<p>'Peace. One must not speak of these things here,' whispered
Kim.<br>
 'There was but one of me. Think again and thou wilt remember.
A<br>
 boy - a Hindu boy - by the great green cannon.'</p>

<p>'But was there not also an Englishman with a white beard
holy<br>
 among images - who himself made more sure my assurance of
the<br>
 River of the Arrow?'</p>

<p>'He - we - went to the Ajaib-Gher in Lahore to pray before
the<br>
 Gods there,' Kim explained to the openly listening company.
'And<br>
 the Sahib of the Wonder House talked to him - yes, this is
truth<br>
 as a brother. He is a very holy man, from far beyond the
Hills.<br>
 Rest, thou. In time we come to Umballa.'</p>

<p>'But my River - the River of my healing?'</p>

<p>'And then, if it please thee, we will go hunting for that
River<br>
 on foot. So that we miss nothing - not even a little rivulet in
a<br>
 field-side.'</p>

<p>'But thou hast a Search of thine own?' The lama - very
pleased<br>
 that he remembered so well - sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>'Ay,' said Kim, humouring him. The boy was entirely happy to
be<br>
 out chewing pan and seeing new people in the great
good-tempered<br>
 world.</p>

<p>'It was a bull - a Red Bull that shall come and help thee
and<br>
 carry thee - whither? I have forgotten. A Red Bull on a
green<br>
 field, was it not?'</p>

<p>'Nay, it will carry me nowhere,' said Kim. 'It is but a tale
I<br>
 told thee.'</p>

<p>'What is this?' The cultivator's wife leaned forward, her<br>
 bracelets clinking on her arm. 'Do ye both dream dreams? A
Red<br>
 Bull on a green field, that shall carry thee to the heavens
or<br>
 what? Was it a vision? Did one make a prophecy? We have a
Red<br>
 Bull in our village behind Jullundur city, and he grazes by<br>
 choice in the very greenest of our fields!'</p>

<p>'Give a woman an old wife's tale and a weaver-bird a leaf and
a<br>
 thread', they will weave wonderful things,' said the Sikh.
'All<br>
 holy men dream dreams, and by following holy men their
disciples<br>
 attain that power.'</p>

<p>'A Red Bull on a green field, was it?' the lama repeated. 'In
a<br>
 former life it may be thou hast acquired merit, and the Bull
will<br>
 come to reward thee.'</p>

<p>'Nay - nay - it was but a tale one told to me - for a jest<br>
 belike. But I will seek the Bull about Umballa, and thou
canst<br>
 look for thy River and rest from the clatter of the train.'</p>

<p>'It may be that the Bull knows - that he is sent to guide
us<br>
 both.' said the lama, hopefully as a child. Then to the
company,<br>
 indicating Kim: 'This one was sent to me but yesterday. He
is<br>
 not, I think, of this world.'</p>

<p>'Beggars aplenty have I met, and holy men to boot, but never
such<br>
 a yogi nor such a disciple,' said the woman.</p>

<p><br>
 Her husband touched his forehead lightly with one finger<br>
 and smiled. But the next time the lama would eat they took
care<br>
 to give him of their best.</p>

<p>And at last - tired, sleepy, and dusty - they reached
Umballa<br>
 City Station.</p>

<p>'We abide here upon a law-suit,' said the cultivator's wife
to<br>
 Kim. 'We lodge with my man's cousin's younger brother. There
is<br>
 room also in the courtyard for thy yogi and for thee. Will-
will<br>
 he give me a blessing?'</p>

<p>'O holy man! A woman with a heart of gold gives us lodging
for<br>
 the night. It is a kindly land, this land of the South. See
how<br>
 we have been helped since the dawn!'</p>

<p>The lama bowed his head in benediction.</p>

<p>'To fill my cousin's younger brother's house with wastrels -'
the<br>
 husband began, as he shouldered his heavy bamboo staff.</p>

<p>'Thy cousin's younger brother owes my father's cousin
something<br>
 yet on his daughter's marriage-feast,' said the woman
crisply.<br>
 'Let him put their food to that account. The yogi will beg,
I<br>
 doubt not.'</p>

<p>'Ay, I beg for him,' said Kim, anxious only to get the lama
under<br>
 shelter for the night, that he might seek Mahbub Ali's
Englishman<br>
 and deliver himself of the white stallion's pedigree.</p>

<p>'Now,' said he, when the lama had come to an anchor in the
inner<br>
 courtyard of a decent Hindu house behind the cantonments, 'I
go<br>
 away for a while - to - to buy us victual in the bazar. Do
not<br>
 stray abroad till I return.'</p>

<p>'Thou wilt return? Thou wilt surely return?' The old man
caught<br>
 at his wrist. 'And thou wilt return in this very same shape?
Is<br>
 it too late to look tonight for the River?'</p>

<p>'Too late and too dark. Be comforted. Think how far thou art
on<br>
 the road - an hundred miles from Lahore already.'</p>

<p><br>
 'Yea - and farther from my monastery. Alas! It is a great
and<br>
 terrible world.'</p>

<p>Kim stole out and away, as unremarkable a figure as ever
carried<br>
 his own and a few score thousand other folk's fate slung
round<br>
 his neck. Mahbub Ali's directions left him little doubt of
the<br>
 house in which his Englishman lived; and a groom, bringing a
dog-<br>
 cart home from the Club, made him quite sure. It remained only
to<br>
 identify his man, and Kim slipped through the garden hedge
and<br>
 hid in a clump of plumed grass close to the veranda. The
house<br>
 blazed with lights, and servants moved about tables dressed
with<br>
 flowers, glass, and silver. Presently forth came an
Englishman,<br>
 dressed in black and - white, humming a tune. It was too dark
to<br>
 see his face, so Kim, beggar-wise, tried an old experiment.</p>

<p>'Protector of the Poor!'</p>

<p>The man backed towards the voice.</p>

<p>'Mahbub Ali says -'</p>

<p>'Hah! What says Mahbub Ali?' He made no attempt to look for
the<br>
 speaker, and that showed Kim that he knew.</p>

<p>'The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.'</p>

<p>'What proof is there?' The Englishman switched at the
rose-hedge<br>
 in the side of the drive.</p>

<p>'Mahbub Ali has given me this proof.' Kim flipped the wad
of<br>
 folded paper into the air, and it fell in the path beside
the<br>
 man, who put his foot on it as a gardener came round the
corner.<br>
 When the servant passed he picked it up, dropped a rupee -
Kim<br>
 could hear the clink - and strode into the house, never
turning<br>
 round. Swiftly Kim took up the money; but for all his
training,<br>
 he was Irish enough by birth to reckon silver the least part
of<br>
 any game. What he desired was the visible effect of action;
so,<br>
 instead of slinking away, he lay close in the grass and
wormed<br>
 nearer to the house.</p>

<p>He saw - Indian bungalows are open through and through the<br>
 Englishman return to a small dressing-room, in a comer of
the<br>
 veranda, that was half office, littered with papers and
despatch-<br>
 boxes, and sit down to study Mahbub Ali's message. His face,
by<br>
 the full ray of the kerosene lamp, changed and darkened, and
Kim,<br>
 used as every beggar must be to watching countenances, took
good<br>
 note.</p>

<p>'Will! Will, dear!' called a woman's voice. 'You ought to be
in<br>
 the drawing-room. They'll be here in a minute.'</p>

<p>The man still read intently.</p>

<p>'Will!' said the voice, five minutes later. 'He's come. I
can<br>
 hear the troopers in the drive.'</p>

<p>The man dashed out bareheaded as a big landau with four
native<br>
 troopers behind it halted at the veranda, and a tall, black<br>
 haired man, erect as an arrow, swung out, preceded by a
young<br>
 officer who laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>Flat on his belly lay Kim, almost touching the high wheels.
His<br>
 man and the black stranger exchanged two sentences.</p>

<p>'Certainly, sir,' said the young officer promptly.
'Everything<br>
 waits while a horse is concerned.'</p>

<p>'We shan't be more than twenty minutes,' said Kim's man. 'You
can<br>
 do the honours -keep 'em amused, and all that.'</p>

<p>'Tell one of the troopers to wait,' said the tall man, and
they<br>
 both passed into the dressing-room together as the landau
rolled<br>
 away. Kim saw their heads bent over Mahbub Ali's message,
and<br>
 heard the voices - one low and deferential, the other sharp
and<br>
 decisive.</p>

<p>'It isn't a question of weeks. It is a question of days -
hours<br>
 almost,' said the elder. 'I'd been expecting it for some
time,<br>
 but this' - he tapped Mahbub Ali's paper - 'clinches it.
Grogan's<br>
 dining here to-night, isn't he?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, and Macklin too.'</p>

<p>'Very good. I'll speak to them myself. The matter will be<br>
 referred to the Council, of course, but this is a case where
one<br>
 is justified in assuming that we take action at once. Warn
the<br>
 Pined and Peshawar brigades. It will disorganize all the
summer<br>
 reliefs, but we can't help that. This comes of not smashing
them<br>
 thoroughly the first time. Eight thousand should be enough.'</p>

<p>'What about artillery, sir?'</p>

<p>'I must consult Macklin.'</p>

<p>'Then it means war?'</p>

<p>'No. Punishment. When a man is bound by the action of his<br>
 predecessor -'</p>

<p>'But C25 may have lied.'</p>

<p>'He bears out the other's information. Practically, they
showed<br>
 their hand six months back. But Devenish would have it there
was<br>
 a chance of peace. Of course they used it to make themselves<br>
 stronger. Send off those telegrams at once - the new code,
not<br>
 the old - mine and Wharton's. I don't think we need keep the<br>
 ladies waiting any longer. We can settle the rest over the<br>
 cigars. I thought it was coming. It's punishment - not war.'</p>

<p>As the trooper cantered off, Kim crawled round to the back of
the<br>
 house, where, going on his Lahore experiences, he judged
there<br>
 would be food - and information. The kitchen was crowded
with<br>
 excited scullions, one of whom kicked him.</p>

<p>'Aie,' said Kim, feigning tears. 'I came only to wash dishes
in<br>
 return for a bellyful.'</p>

<p>'All Umballa is on the same errand. Get hence. They go in
now<br>
 with the soup. Think you that we who serve Creighton Sahib
need<br>
 strange scullions to help us through a big dinner?'</p>

<p>'It is a very big dinner,' said Kim, looking at the
plates.</p>

<p>'Small wonder. The guest of honour is none other than the
Jang-i-<br>
 Lat Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief].'</p>

<p>'Ho!' said Kim, with the correct guttural note of wonder. He
had<br>
 learned what he wanted, and when the scullion turned he was
gone.</p>

<p>'And all that trouble,' said he to himself, thinking as usual
in<br>
 Hindustani, 'for a horse's pedigree! Mahbub Ali should have
come<br>
 to me to learn a little lying. Every time before that I have<br>
 borne a message it concerned a woman. Now it is men. Better.
The<br>
 tall man said that they will loose a great army to punish
someone<br>
 -somewhere - the news goes to Pindi and Peshawur. There are
also<br>
 guns. Would I had crept nearer. It is big news!'</p>

<p>He returned to find the cultivator's cousin's younger
brother<br>
 discussing the family law-suit in all its bearings with the<br>
 cultivator and his wife and a few friends, while the lama
dozed.<br>
 After the evening meal some one passed him a water-pipe; and
Kim<br>
 felt very much of a man as he pulled at the smooth
coconut-shell,<br>
 his legs spread abroad in the moonlight, his tongue clicking
in<br>
 remarks from time to time. His hosts were most polite; for
the<br>
 cultivator's wife had told them of his vision of the Red
Bull,<br>
 and of his probable descent from another world. Moreover,
the<br>
 lama was a great and venerable curiosity.</p>

<p><br>
 The family priest, an old, tolerant Sarsut Brahmin, dropped
in<br>
 later, and naturally started a theological argument to
impress<br>
 the family. By creed, of course, they were all on their
priest's<br>
 side, but the lama was the guest and the novelty. His gentle<br>
 kindliness, and his impressive Chinese quotations, that
sounded<br>
 like spells, delighted them hugely; and in this sympathetic,<br>
 simple air, he expanded like the Bodhisat's own lotus,
speaking<br>
 of his life in the great hills of Such-zen, before, as he
said,<br>
 'I rose up to seek enlightenment.'</p>

<p>Then it came out that in those worldly days he had been a
master-<br>
 hand at casting horoscopes and nativities; and the family
priest<br>
 led him on to describe his methods; each giving the planets
names<br>
 that the other could not understand, and pointing upwards as
the<br>
 big stars sailed across the dark. The children of the house<br>
 tugged unrebuked at his rosary; and he clean forgot the Rule<br>
 which forbids looking at women as he talked of enduring
snows,<br>
 landslips, blocked passes, the remote cliffs where men find<br>
 sapphires and turquoise, and that wonderful upland road that<br>
 leads at last into Great China itself.</p>

<p>'How thinkest thou of this one?' said the cultivator aside to
the<br>
 priest.</p>

<p>'A holy man - a holy man indeed. His Gods are not the Gods,
but<br>
 his feet are upon the Way,' was the answer. 'And his methods
of<br>
 nativities, though that is beyond thee, are wise and sure.1</p>

<p>'Tell me,' said Kim lazily, 'whether I find my Red Bull on
a<br>
 green field, as was promised me.'</p>

<p>'What knowledge hast thou of thy birth-hour?' the priest
asked,<br>
 swelling with importance.</p>

<p>'Between first and second cockcrow of the first night in
May.'</p>

<p>'Of what year?'</p>

<p>'I do not know; but upon the hour that I cried first fell
the<br>
 great earthquake in Srinagar which is in Kashmir.' This Kim
had<br>
 from the woman who took care of him, and she again from
Kimball<br>
 O'Hara. The earthquake had been felt in India, and for long
stood<br>
 a leading date in the Punjab.</p>

<p>'Ai!' said a woman excitedly. This seemed to make Kim's<br>
 supernatural origin more certain. "Was not such an one's
daughter<br>
 born then -'</p>

<p>'And her mother bore her husband four sons in four years
all<br>
 likely boys,' cried the cultivator's wife, sitting outside
the<br>
 circle in the shadow.</p>

<p>'None reared in the knowledge,' said the family priest,
'forget<br>
 how the planets stood in their Houses upon that night.' He
began<br>
 to draw in the dust of the courtyard. 'At least thou hast
good<br>
 claim to a half of the House of the Bull. How runs thy
prophecy?'</p>

<p>'Upon a day,' said Kim, delighted at the sensation he was<br>
 creating, 'I shall be made great by means of a Red Bull on a<br>
 green field, but first there will enter two men making all
things<br>
 ready.'</p>

<p>'Yes: thus ever at the opening of a vision. A thick darkness
that<br>
 clears slowly; anon one enters with a broom making ready the<br>
 place. Then begins the Sight. Two men - thou sayest? Ay, ay.
The<br>
 Sun, leaving the House of the Bull, enters that of the
Twins.<br>
 Hence the two men of the prophecy. Let us now consider. Fetch
me<br>
 a twig, little one.'</p>

<p>He knitted his brows, scratched, smoothed out, and
scratched<br>
 again in the dust mysterious signs - to the wonder of all
save<br>
 the lama, who, with fine instinct, forbore to interfere.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour, he tossed the twig from him with
a<br>
 grunt.</p>

<p>'Hm! Thus say the stars. Within three days come the two men
to<br>
 make all things ready. After them follows the Bull; but the
sign<br>
 over against him is the sign of War and armed men.'</p>

<p>'There was indeed a man of the Ludhiana Sikhs in the
carriage<br>
 from Lahore,' said the cultivator's wife hopefully.</p>

<p>'Tck! Armed men - many hundreds. What concern hast thou
with<br>
 war?' said the priest to Kim. 'Thine is a red and an angry
sign<br>
 of War to be loosed very soon.'</p>

<p>'None - none.' said the lama earnestly. 'We seek only peace
and<br>
 our River.'</p>

<p>Kim smiled, remembering what he had overheard in the
dressing-<br>
 room. Decidedly he was a favourite of the stars.</p>

<p>The priest brushed his foot over the rude horoscope. 'More
than<br>
 this I cannot see. In three days comes the Bull to thee,
boy.'</p>

<p>'And my River, my River,' pleaded the lama. 'I had hoped his
Bull<br>
 would lead us both to the River.'</p>

<p>'Alas, for that wondrous River, my brother,' the priest
replied.<br>
 'Such things are not common.'</p>

<p>Next morning, though they were pressed to stay, the lama
insisted<br>
 on departure. They gave Kim a large bundle of good food and<br>
 nearly three annas in copper money for the needs of the road,
and<br>
 with many blessings watched the two go southward in the
dawn.</p>

<p>'Pity it is that these and such as these could not be freed
from</p>

<p>'Nay, then would only evil people be left on the earth, and
who<br>
 would give us meat and shelter?' quoth Kim, stepping merrily<br>
 under his burden.</p>

<p>'Yonder is a small stream. Let us look,' said the lama, and
he<br>
 led from the white road across the fields; walking into a
very<br>
 hornets' nest of pariah dogs.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><br>
 Yea, voice of every Soul that clung<br>
To life that strove from rung to rung<br>
 When Devadatta's rule was young,<br>
 The warm wind brings Kamakura.</p>

<p>Buddha at Kamakura.</p>

<p><br>
 Behind them an angry farmer brandished a bamboo pole. He was
a<br>
 market-gardener, Arain by caste, growing vegetables and
flowers<br>
 for Umballa city, and well Kim knew the breed.</p>

<p><br>
 'Such an one,' said the lama, disregarding the dogs, 'is
impolite<br>
 to strangers, intemperate of speech and uncharitable. Be
warned<br>
 by his demeanour, my disciple.'</p>

<p>'Ho, shameless beggars!' shouted the farmer. 'Begone! Get
hence!'</p>

<p>'We go,' the lama returned, with quiet dignity. 'We go from
these<br>
 unblessed fields.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' said Kim, sucking in his breath. 'If the next crops
fail,<br>
 thou canst only blame thine own tongue.'</p>

<p>The man shuffled uneasily in his slippers. 'The land is full
of<br>
 beggars,' he began, half apologetically.</p>

<p>'And by what sign didst thou know that we would beg from thee,
O<br>
 Mali?' said Kim tartly, using the name that a
market-gardener<br>
 least likes. 'All we sought was to look at that river beyond
the<br>
 field there.'</p>

<p>'River, forsooth!' the man snorted. 'What city do ye hail
from<br>
 not to know a canal-cut? It runs as straight as an arrow ' and
I<br>
 pay for the water as though it were molten silver. There is
a<br>
 branch of a river beyond. But if ye need water I can give that
-<br>
 and milk.'</p>

<p>'Nay, we will go to the river,' said the lama, striding
out.</p>

<p>'Milk and a meal.' the man stammered, as he looked at the
strange<br>
 tall figure. 'I - I would not draw evil upon myself - or my<br>
 crops. But beggars are so many in these hard days.'</p>

<p>'Take notice.' The lama turned to Kim. 'He was led to
speak<br>
 harshly by the Red Mist of anger. That clearing from his eyes,
he<br>
 becomes courteous and of an affable heart. May his fields be<br>
 blessed! Beware not to judge men too hastily, O farmer.'</p>

<p>'I have met holy ones who would have cursed thee from
hearthstone<br>
 to byre,' said Kim to the abashed man. 'Is he not wise and
holy?<br>
 I am his disciple.'</p>

<p>He cocked his nose in the air loftily and stepped across
the<br>
 narrow field-borders with great dignity.</p>

<p>'There is no pride,' said the lama, after a pause, 'there is
no<br>
 pride among such as follow the Middle Way.'</p>

<p>'But thou hast said he was low-caste and discourteous.'</p>

<p>'Low-caste I did not say, for how can that be which is
not?<br>
 Afterwards he amended his discourtesy, and I forgot the
offence.<br>
 Moreover, he is as we are, bound upon the Wheel of Things; but
he<br>
 does not tread the way of deliverance.' He halted at a
little<br>
 runlet among the fields, and considered the hoof-pitted
bank.</p>

<p>'Now, how wilt thou know thy River?' said Kim, squatting in
the<br>
 shade of some tall sugar-cane.</p>

<p>'When I find it, an enlightenment will surely be given. This,
I<br>
 feel, is not the place. O littlest among the waters, if only
thou<br>
 couldst tell me where runs my River! But be thou blessed to
make<br>
 the fields bear!'</p>

<p>'Look! Look!' Kim sprang to his side and dragged him back.
A<br>
 yellow-and-brown streak glided from the purple rustling stems
to<br>
 the bank, stretched its neck to the water, drank, and lay still
-<br>
 a big cobra with fixed, lidless eyes.</p>

<p>'I have no stick - I have no stick,' said Kim. '1 will get me
one<br>
 and break his back.'</p>

<p>'Why? He is upon the Wheel as we are - a life ascending or<br>
 descending - very far from deliverance. Great evil must the
soul<br>
 have done that is cast into this shape.'</p>

<p>'I hate all snakes,' said Kim. No native training can quench
the<br>
 white man's horror of the Serpent.</p>

<p>'Let him live out his life.' The coiled thing hissed and
half<br>
 opened its hood. 'May thy release come soon, brother!' the
lama<br>
 continued placidly. 'Hast thou knowledge, by chance, of my<br>
 River?'</p>

<p>'Never have I seen such a man as thou art,' Kim whispered,<br>
 overwhelmed. 'Do the very snakes understand thy talk?'</p>

<p>'Who knows?' He passed within a foot of the cobra's poised
head.<br>
 It flattened itself among the dusty coils.</p>

<p>'Come, thou!' he called over his shoulder.</p>

<p>'Not I,' said Kim'. 'I go round.'</p>

<p>'Come. He does no hurt.'</p>

<p>Kim hesitated for a moment. The lama backed his order by
some<br>
 droned Chinese quotation which Kim took for a charm. He
obeyed<br>
 and bounded across the rivulet, and the snake, indeed, made
no<br>
 sign.</p>

<p>'Never have I seen such a man.' Kim wiped the sweat from
his<br>
 forehead. 'And now, whither go we?'</p>

<p>'That is for thee to say. I am old, and a stranger - far from
my<br>
 own place. But that the rel-carriage fills my head with noises
of<br>
 devil-drums I would go in it to Benares now ... Yet by so
going<br>
 we may miss the River. Let us find another river.'</p>

<p>Where the hard-worked soil gives three and even four crops a
year<br>
 through patches of sugar-cane, tobacco, long white radishes,<br>
 and nol-kol, all that day they strolled on, turning aside to<br>
 every glimpse of water; rousing village dogs and sleeping<br>
 villages at noonday; the lama replying to the volleyed
questions<br>
 with an unswerving simplicity. They sought a River a River
of<br>
 miraculous healing. Had any one knowledge of such a stream?<br>
 Sometimes men laughed, but more often heard the story out to
the<br>
 end and offered them a place in the shade, a drink of milk, and
a<br>
 meal. The women were always kind, and the little children as<br>
 children are the world over, alternately shy and
venturesome.<br>
 Evening found them at rest under the village tree of a mud-<br>
 walled, mud-roofed hamlet, talking to the headman as the
cattle<br>
 came in from the grazing-grounds and the women prepared the
day's<br>
 last meal. They had passed beyond the belt of market-gardens<br>
 round hungry Umballa, and were among the mile-wide green of
the<br>
 staple crops.</p>

<p>He was a white-bearded and affable elder, used to
entertaining<br>
 strangers. He dragged out a string bedstead for the lama,
set<br>
 warm cooked food before him, prepared him a pipe, and, the<br>
 evening ceremonies being finished in the village temple, sent
for<br>
 the village priest.</p>

<p>Kim told the older children tales of the size and beauty
of<br>
 Lahore, of railway travel, and such-like city things, while
the<br>
 men talked, slowly as their cattle chew the cud.</p>

<p>'I cannot fathom it,' said the headman at last to the
priest.<br>
 'How readest thou this talk?' The lama, his tale told, was<br>
 silently telling his beads.</p>

<p>'He is a Seeker.' the priest answered. 'The land is full of
such.<br>
 Remember him who came only last, month - the fakir with the<br>
 tortoise?'</p>

<p>'Ay, but that man had right and reason, for Krishna
Himself<br>
 appeared in a vision promising him Paradise without the
burning-<br>
 pyre if he journeyed to Prayag. This man seeks no God who is<br>
 within my knowledge.'</p>

<p>'Peace, he is old: he comes from far off, and he is mad,'
the<br>
 smooth-shaven priest replied. 'Hear me.' He turned to the
lama.<br>
 'Three koss [six miles] to the westward runs the great road
to<br>
 Calcutta.'</p>

<p>'But I would go to Benares - to Benares.'</p>

<p>'And to Benares also. It crosses all streams on this side
of<br>
 Hind. Now my word to thee, Holy One, is rest here till
tomorrow.<br>
 Then take the road' (it was the Grand Trunk Road he meant)
'and<br>
 test each stream that it overpasses; for, as I understand,
the<br>
 virtue of thy River lies neither in one pool nor place, but<br>
 throughout its length. Then, if thy Gods will, be assured
that<br>
 thou wilt come upon thy freedom.'</p>

<p>'That is well said.' The lama was much impressed by the plan.
'We<br>
 will begin tomorrow, and a blessing on thee for showing old
feet<br>
 such a near road.' A deep, sing-song Chinese half-chant
closed<br>
 the sentence. Even the priest was impressed, and the headman<br>
 feared an evil spell: but none could look at the lama's
simple,<br>
 eager face and doubt him long.</p>

<p>'Seest thou my chela?' he said, diving into his snuff-gourd
with<br>
 an important sniff. It was his duty to repay courtesy with<br>
 courtesy.</p>

<p>'I see - and hear.' The headman rolled his eye where Kim
was<br>
 chatting to a girl in blue as she laid crackling thorns on a<br>
 fire.</p>

<p>'He also has a Search of his own. No river, but a Bull. Yea,
a<br>
 Red Bull on a green field will some day raise him to honour.
He<br>
 is, I think, not altogether of this world. He was sent of a<br>
 sudden to aid me in this search, and his name is Friend of
all<br>
 the World.'</p>

<p>The priest smiled. 'Ho, there, Friend of all the World,' he
cried<br>
 across the sharp-smelling smoke, 'what art thou?'</p>

<p>'This Holy One's disciple,' said Kim.</p>

<p>'He says thou are a but [a spirit].'</p>

<p>'Can buts eat?' said Kim, with a twinkle. 'For I am
hungry.'</p>

<p>'It is no jest,' cried the lama. 'A certain astrologer of that
city<br>
 whose name I have forgotten -'</p>

<p>'That is no more than the city of Umballa where we slept
last<br>
 night,' Kim whispered to the priest.</p>

<p>'Ay, Umballa was it? He cast a horoscope and declared that
my<br>
 chela should find his desire within two days. But what said he
of<br>
 the meaning of the stars, Friend of all the World?'</p>

<p>Kim cleared his throat and looked around at the village<br>
 greybeards.</p>

<p>'The meaning of my Star is War,' he replied pompously.</p>

<p>Somebody laughed at the little tattered figure strutting on
the<br>
 brickwork plinth under the great tree. Where a native would
have<br>
 lain down, Kim's white blood set him upon his feet.</p>

<p>'Ay, War,' he answered.</p>

<p>'That is a sure prophecy,' rumbled a deep voice. 'For there
is<br>
 always war along the Border -as I know.'</p>

<p>It was an old, withered man, who had served the Government in
the<br>
 days of the Mutiny as a native officer in a newly raised
cavalry<br>
 regiment. The Government had given him a good holding in the<br>
 village, and though the demands of his sons, now
grey-bearded<br>
 officers on their own account, had impoverished him, he was
still<br>
 a person of consequence. English officials - Deputy
Commissioners<br>
 even - turned aside from the main road to visit him, and on
those<br>
 occasions he dressed himself in the uniform of ancient days,
and<br>
 stood up like a ramrod.</p>

<p>'But this shall be a great war - a war of eight thousand.'
Kim's<br>
 voice shrilled across the quick-gathering crowd, astonishing<br>
 himself.</p>

<p>'Redcoats or our own regiments?' the old man snapped, as
though<br>
 he were asking an equal. His tone made men respect Kim.</p>

<p>'Redcoats,' said Kim at a venture. 'Redcoats and guns.'</p>

<p>'But - but the astrologer said no word of this,' cried the
lama,<br>
 snuffing prodigiously in his excitement.</p>

<p>'But I know. The word has come to me, who am this Holy
One's<br>
 disciple. There will rise a war - a war of eight thousand
redcoats.<br>
 &gt;From Pindi and Peshawur they will be drawn. This is<br>
 sure.</p>

<p>'The boy has heard bazar-talk,' said the priest.</p>

<p>'But he was always by my side,' said the lama. 'How should he
know?<br>
 I did not know.'</p>

<p>'He will make a clever juggler when the old man is dead,'
muttered<br>
 the priest to the headman. 'What new trick is this?'</p>

<p>'A sign. Give me a sign,' thundered the old soldier suddenly.
'If<br>
 there were war my sons would have told me.'</p>

<p>'When all is ready, thy sons, doubt not, will be told. But it
is a<br>
 long road from thy sons to the man in whose hands these
things<br>
 lie.' Kim warmed to the game, for it reminded him of
experiences<br>
 in the letter-carrying line, when, for the sake of a few pice,
he<br>
 pretended to know more than he knew. But now he was playing
for<br>
 larger things - the sheer excitement and the sense of power.
He<br>
 drew a new breath and went on.</p>

<p>'Old man, give me a sign. Do underlings order the goings of
eight<br>
 thousand redcoats -with guns?'</p>

<p>'No.' Still the old man answered as though Kim were an
equal.</p>

<p>'Dost thou know who He is, then, that gives the order?'</p>

<p>'I have seen Him.'</p>

<p>'To know again?'</p>

<p>'I have known Him since he was a lieutenant in the topkhana
(the<br>
 Artillery].'</p>

<p>'A tall man. A tall man with black hair, walking thus?' Kim
took<br>
 a few paces in a stiff, wooden style.</p>

<p>'Ay. But that anyone may have seen.' The crowd were
breathless-<br>
 still through all this talk.</p>

<p>'That is true,' said Kim. 'But I will say more. Look now.
First<br>
 the great man walks thus. Then He thinks thus.' (Kim drew a<br>
 forefinger over his forehead and downwards till it came to
rest<br>
 by the angle of the jaw.) 'Anon He twitches his fingers
thus.<br>
 Anon He thrusts his hat under his left armpit.' Kim
illustrated<br>
 the motion and stood like a stork.</p>

<p>The old man groaned, inarticulate with amazement; and the
crowd<br>
 shivered.</p>

<p>'So - so - so. But what does He when He is about to give an
order?'</p>

<p>'He rubs the skin at the back of his neck - thus. Then falls
one<br>
 finger on the table and He makes a small sniffing noise
through<br>
 his nose. Then He speaks, saying: "Loose such and such a
regiment.<br>
 Call out such guns."'</p>

<p>The old man rose stiffly and saluted.</p>

<p>'"For"' - Kim translated into the vernacular the clinching<br>
 sentences he had heard in the dressing-room at Umballa -
'"For,"<br>
 says He, "we should have done this long ago. It is not war - it
is<br>
 a chastisement. Snff!"'</p>

<p>'Enough. I believe. I have seen Him thus in the smoke of
battles.<br>
 Seen and heard. It is He!'</p>

<p>'I saw no smoke' - Kim's voice shifted to the rapt sing-song
of the<br>
 wayside fortune-teller. 'I saw this in darkness. First came a
man<br>
 to make things clear. Then came horsemen. Then came He. standing
in<br>
 a ring of light. The rest followed as I have said. Old man, have
I<br>
 spoken truth?'</p>

<p>'It is He. Past all doubt it is He.'</p>

<p>The crowd drew a long, quavering breath, staring alternately
at the<br>
 old man, still at attention, and ragged Kim against the
purple<br>
 twilight.</p>

<p>'Said I not - said I not he was from the other world?' cried
the<br>
 lama proudly. 'He is the Friend of all the World. He is the<br>
 Friend of the Stars!'</p>

<p>'At least it does not concern us,' a man cried. 'O thou
young<br>
 soothsayer, if the gift abides with thee at all seasons, I have
a<br>
 red-spotted cow. She may be sister to thy Bull for aught I know
-<br>
 '</p>

<p>'Or I care,' said Kim. 'My Stars do not concern themselves
with thy<br>
 cattle.'</p>

<p>'Nay, but she is very sick,' a woman struck in. 'My man is
a<br>
 buffalo, or he would have chosen his words better. Tell me if
she<br>
 recover?'</p>

<p>Had Kim been at all an ordinary boy, he would have carried on
the<br>
 play; but one does not know Lahore city, and least of all
the<br>
 fakirs by the Taksali Gate, for thirteen years without also
knowing<br>
 human nature.</p>

<p>The priest looked at him sideways, something bitterly - a dry
and<br>
 blighting smile.</p>

<p>'Is there no priest, then, in the village? I thought I had
seen a<br>
 great one even now,' cried Kim.</p>

<p>'Ay - but -' the woman began.</p>

<p>'But thou and thy husband hoped to get the cow cured for a
handful<br>
 of thanks.' The shot told: they were notoriously the
closest-fisted<br>
 couple in the village. 'It is not well to cheat the temples.
Give a<br>
 young calf to thine own priest, and, unless thy Gods are angry
past<br>
 recall, she will give milk within a month.'</p>

<p>'A master-beggar art thou,' purred the priest approvingly.
'Not the<br>
 cunning of forty years could have done better. Surely thou
hast<br>
 made the old man rich?'</p>

<p>'A little flour, a little butter and a mouthful of cardamoms,'
Kim<br>
 retorted, flushed with the praise, but still cautious -'Does
one<br>
 grow rich on that? And, as thou canst see, he is mad. But it
serves<br>
 me while I learn the road at least."</p>

<p>He knew what the fakirs of the Taksali Gate were like when
they<br>
 talked among themselves, and copied the very inflection of
their<br>
 lewd disciples.</p>

<p>'Is his Search, then, truth or a cloak to other ends? It may
be<br>
 treasure.'</p>

<p>'He is mad - many times mad. There is nothing else.'</p>

<p>Here the old soldier bobbled up and asked if Kim would accept
his<br>
 hospitality for the night. The priest recommended him to do so,
but<br>
 insisted that the honour of entertaining the lama belonged to
the<br>
 temple - at which the lama smiled guilelessly. Kim glanced from
one<br>
 face to the other, and drew his own conclusions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br>
 'Where is the money?' he whispered, beckoning the old man off
into<br>
 the darkness.</p>

<p>'In my bosom. Where else?'</p>

<p>'Give it me. Quietly and swiftly give it me.'</p>

<p>'But why? Here is no ticket to buy.'</p>

<p>'Am I thy chela, or am I not? Do I not safeguard thy old feet
about<br>
 the ways? Give me the money and at dawn I will return it.'
He<br>
 slipped his hand above the lama's girdle and brought away
the<br>
 purse.</p>

<p>'Be it so - be it so.' The old man nodded his head. 'This is
a<br>
 great and terrible world. I never knew there were so many men
alive<br>
 in it.'</p>

<p>Next morning the priest was in a very bad temper, but the lama
was<br>
 quite happy; and Kim had enjoyed a most interesting evening
with<br>
 the old man, who brought out his cavalry sabre and, balancing it
on<br>
 his dry knees, told tales of the Mutiny and young captains
thirty<br>
 years in their graves, till Kim dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>'Certainly the air of this country is good,' said the lama.
'I<br>
 sleep lightly, as do all old men; but last night I slept
unwaking<br>
 till broad day. Even now I am heavy.'</p>

<p>'Drink a draught of hot milk,' said Kim, who had carried not a
few<br>
 such remedies to opium-smokers of his acquaintance. 'It is time
to<br>
 take the Road again.'</p>

<p>'The long Road that overpasses all the rivers of Hind,' said
the<br>
 lama gaily. 'Let us go. But how thinkest thou, chela, to
recompense<br>
 these people, and especially the priest, for their great
kindness?<br>
 Truly they are but-parast, but in other lives, maybe, they
will<br>
 receive enlightenment. A rupee to the temple? The thing within
is<br>
 no more than stone and red paint, but the heart of man we
must<br>
 acknowledge when and where it is good.'</p>

<p>'Holy One, hast thou ever taken the Road alone?' Kim looked
up<br>
 sharply, like the Indian crows so busy about the fields.</p>

<p>'Surely, child: from Kulu to Pathankot - from Kulu, where my
first<br>
 chela died. When men were kind to us we made offerings, and all
men<br>
 were well-disposed throughout all the Hills.'</p>

<p>'It is otherwise in Hind,' said Kim drily. 'Their Gods are
many-<br>
 armed and malignant. Let them alone.'</p>

<p>'I would set thee on thy road for a little, Friend of all the
World<br>
 thou and thy yellow man.' The old soldier ambled up the
village<br>
 street, all shadowy in the dawn, on a punt, scissor-hocked
pony.<br>
 'Last night broke up the fountains of remembrance in my
so-dried<br>
 heart, and it was as a blessing to me. Truly there is war abroad
in<br>
 the air. I smell it. See! I have brought my sword.'</p>

<p>He sat long-legged on the little beast, with the big sword at
his<br>
 side -hand dropped on the pommel - staring fiercely over the
flat<br>
 lands towards the North. 'Tell me again how He showed in thy<br>
 vision. Come up and sit behind me. The beast will carry
two.'</p>

<p>'I am this Holy One's disciple,' said Kim, as they cleared
the<br>
 village-gate. The villagers seemed almost sorry to be rid of
them,<br>
 but the priest's farewell was cold and distant. He had wasted
some<br>
 opium on a man who carried no money.</p>

<p>'That is well spoken. I am not much used to holy men, but
respect<br>
 is always good. There is no respect in these days - not even
when<br>
 a Commissioner Sahib comes to see me. But why should one
whose<br>
 Star leads him to war follow a holy man?'</p>

<p>'But he is a holy man,' said Kim earnestly. 'In truth, and in
talk<br>
 and in act, holy. He is not like the others. I have never seen
such<br>
 an one. We be not fortune-tellers, or jugglers, or beggars.'</p>

<p>'Thou art not. That I can see. But I do not know that other.
He<br>
 marches well, though.'</p>

<p>The first freshness of the day carried the lama forward with
long,<br>
 easy, camel-like strides. He was deep in meditation,
mechanically<br>
 clicking his rosary.</p>

<p>They followed the rutted and worn country road that wound
across<br>
 the flat between the great dark-green mango-groves, the line of
the<br>
 snowcapped Himalayas faint to the eastward. All India was at
work<br>
 in the fields, to the creaking of well-wheels, the shouting
of<br>
 ploughmen behind their cattle, and the clamour of the crows.
Even<br>
 the pony felt the good influence and almost broke into a trot
as<br>
 Kim laid a hand on the stirrup-leather.</p>

<p>'It repents me that I did not give a rupee to the shrine,'
said the<br>
 lama on the last bead of his eighty-one.</p>

<p>The old soldier growled in his beard, so that the lama for
the<br>
 first time was aware of him.</p>

<p>'Seekest thou the River also?' said he, turning.</p>

<p>'The day is new,' was the reply. 'What need of a river save
to<br>
 water at before sundown? I come to show thee a short lane to
the<br>
 Big Road.'</p>

<p>'That is a courtesy to be remembered, O man of good will. But
why<br>
 the sword?'</p>

<p>The old soldier looked as abashed as a child interrupted in
his<br>
 game of make-believe.</p>

<p>'The sword,' he said, fumbling it. 'Oh, that was a fancy of
mine<br>
 an old man's fancy. Truly the police orders are that no man
must<br>
 bear weapons throughout Hind, but' - he cheered up and slapped
the<br>
 hilt - 'all the constabeels hereabout know me.'</p>

<p>'It is not a good fancy,' said the lama. 'What profit to kill
men?'</p>

<p>'Very little - as I know; but if evil men were not now and
then<br>
 slain it would not be a good world for weaponless dreamers. I
do<br>
 not speak without knowledge who have seen the land from Delhi
south<br>
 awash with blood.'</p>

<p>'What madness was that, then?'</p>

<p>'The Gods', who sent it for a plague, alone know. A madness
ate<br>
 into all the Army, and they turned against their officers.
That<br>
 was the first evil, but not past remedy if they had then held
their<br>
 hands. But they chose to kill the Sahibs' wives and children.
Then<br>
 came the Sahibs from over the sea and called them to most
strict<br>
 account.'</p>

<p>'Some such rumour, I believe, reached me once long ago.
They<br>
 called it the Black Year, as I remember.'</p>

<p>'What manner of life hast thou led, not to know The Year? A
rumour<br>
 indeed! All earth knew, and trembled!'</p>

<p>'Our earth never shook but once - upon the day that the
Excellent<br>
 One received Enlightenment.'</p>

<p>'Umph! I saw Delhi shake at least- and Delhi is the navel of
the<br>
 world.'</p>

<p>'So they turned against women and children? That was a bad
deed,<br>
 for which the punishment cannot be avoided.'</p>

<p>'Many strove to do so, but with very small profit. I was then
in<br>
 a regiment of cavalry. It broke. Of six hundred and eighty
sabres<br>
 stood fast to their salt - how many, think you? Three. Of whom
I<br>
 was one.'</p>

<p>'The greater merit.'</p>

<p>'Merit! We did not consider it merit in those days. My people,
my<br>
 friends, my brothers fell from me. They said: "The time of
the<br>
 English is accomplished. Let each strike out a little holding
for<br>
 himself." But I had talked with the men of Sobraon, of<br>
 Chilianwallah, of Moodkee and Ferozeshah. I said: "Abide a
little<br>
 and the wind turns. There is no blessing in this work." In
those<br>
 days I rode seventy miles with an English Memsahib and her babe
on<br>
 my saddle-bow. (Wow! That was a horse fit for a man!) I placed
them<br>
 in safety, and back came I to my officer the one that was
not<br>
 killed of our five. "Give me work," said I, "for I am an
outcast<br>
 among my own kind, and my cousin's blood is wet on my sabre."
"Be<br>
 content," said he. "There is great work forward. When this
madness<br>
 is over there is a recompense."'</p>

<p>'Ay, there is a recompense when the madness is over, surely?'
the<br>
 lama muttered half to himself.</p>

<p>'They did not hang medals in those days on all who by accident
had<br>
 heard a gun fired. No! In nineteen pitched battles was I; in
six-<br>
 and-forty skirmishes of horse; and in small affairs without
number.<br>
 Nine wounds I bear; a medal and four clasps and the medal of
an<br>
 Order, for my captains, who are now generals, remembered me
when<br>
 the Kaisar-i-Hind had accomplished fifty years of her reign,
and<br>
 all the land rejoiced. They said: "Give him the Order of
Berittish<br>
 India." I carry it upon my neck now. I have also my jaghir<br>
 [holding] from the hands of the State - a free gift to me and
mine.<br>
 The men of the old days -they are now Commissioners - come
riding<br>
 to me through the crops - high upon horses so that all the
village<br>
 sees - and we talk out the old skirmishes, one dead man's
name<br>
 leading to another.'</p>

<p>'And after?' said the lama.</p>

<p>'Oh, afterwards they go away, but not before my village has
seen.</p>

<p>'And at the last what wilt thou do?'</p>

<p>'At the last I shall die.'</p>

<p>'And after?'</p>

<p>'Let the Gods order it. I have never pestered Them with
prayers.<br>
 I do not think They will pester me. Look you, I have noticed in
my<br>
 long life that those who eternally break in upon Those Above
with<br>
 complaints and reports and bellowings and weepings are
presently<br>
 sent for in haste, as our Colonel used to send for
slack-jawed<br>
 down-country men who talked too much. No, I have never wearied
the<br>
 Gods. They will remember this, and give me a quiet place where
I<br>
 can drive my lance in the shade, and wait to welcome my sons:
I<br>
 have no less than three Rissaldar-majors all - in the
regiments.'</p>

<p>'And they likewise, bound upon the Wheel, go forth from life
to<br>
 life - from despair to despair,' said the lama below his
breath,<br>
 'hot, uneasy, snatching.'</p>

<p>'Ay,' the old soldier chuckled. 'Three Rissaldar-majors in
three<br>
 regiments. Gamblers a little, but so am I. They must be well<br>
 mounted; and one cannot take the horses as in the old days one
took<br>
 women. Well, well, my holding can pay for all. How thinkest
thou?<br>
 It is a well-watered strip, but my men cheat me. I do not know
how<br>
 to ask save at the lance's point. Ugh! I grow angry and I
curse<br>
 them, and they feign penitence, but behind my back I know they
call<br>
 me a toothless old ape.'</p>

<p>'Hast thou never desired any other thing?'</p>

<p>'Yes - yes - a thousand times! A straight back and a
close-clinging<br>
 knee once more; a quick wrist and a keen eye; and the marrow
that<br>
 makes a man. Oh, the old days - the good days of my
strength!'</p>

<p>'That strength is weakness.'</p>

<p>'It has turned so; but fifty years since I could have proved
it<br>
 otherwise,' the old soldier retorted, driving his stirrup-edge
into<br>
 the pony's lean flank.</p>

<p>'But I know a River of great healing.'</p>

<p>'I have drank Gunga-water to the edge of dropsy. All she gave
me<br>
 was a flux, and no sort of strength.'</p>

<p><br>
 'It is not Gunga. The River that I know washes from all taint
of<br>
 sin. Ascending the far bank one is assured of Freedom. I do
not<br>
 know thy life, but thy face is the face of the honourable
and<br>
 courteous. Thou hast clung to thy Way, rendering fidelity when
it<br>
 was hard to give, in that Black Year of which I now remember<br>
 other tales. Enter now upon the Middle Way which is the path
to<br>
 Freedom. Hear the Most Excellent Law, and do not follow
dreams.'</p>

<p>'Speak, then, old man,' the soldier smiled, half saluting. 'We
be<br>
 all babblers at our age.'</p>

<p>The lama squatted under the shade of a mango, whose shadow
played<br>
 checkerwise over his face; the soldier sat stiffly on the
pony;<br>
 and Kim, making sure that there were no snakes, lay down in
the<br>
 crotch of the twisted roots.</p>

<p>There was a drowsy buzz of small life in hot sunshine, a
cooing<br>
 of doves, and a sleepy drone of well-wheels across the
fields.<br>
 Slowly and impressively the lama began. At the end of ten
minutes<br>
 the old soldier slid from his pony, to hear better as he
said,<br>
 and sat with the reins round his wrist. The lama's voice
faltered<br>
 the periods lengthened. Kim was busy watching a grey
squirrel.<br>
 When the little scolding bunch of fur, close pressed to the<br>
 branch, disappeared, preacher and audience were fast asleep,
the<br>
 old officer's strong-cut head pillowed on his arm, the
lama's<br>
 thrown back against the tree-bole, where it showed like
yellow<br>
 ivory. A naked child toddled up, stared, and, moved by some
quick<br>
 impulse of reverence, made a solemn little obeisance before
the<br>
 lama - only the child was so short and fat that it toppled
over<br>
 sideways, and Kim laughed at the sprawling, chubby legs. The<br>
 child, scared and indignant, yelled aloud.</p>

<p>'Hai! Hai!' said the soldier, leaping to his feet. 'What is
it?<br>
 What orders? ... It is ... a child! I dreamed it was an
alarm.<br>
 Little one - little one - do not cry. Have I slept? That was<br>
 discourteous indeed!'</p>

<p>'I fear! I am afraid!' roared the child.</p>

<p>'What is it to fear? Two old men and a boy? How wilt thou ever
make<br>
 a soldier, Princeling?'</p>

<p>The lama had waked too, but, taking no direct notice of the
child,<br>
 clicked his rosary.</p>

<p>'What is that?' said the child, stopping a yell midway. 'I
have<br>
 never seen such things. Give them me.'</p>

<p>'Aha.' said the lama, smiling, and trailing a loop of it on
the<br>
 grass:</p>

<p>This is a handful of cardamoms,<br>
 This is a lump of ghi:<br>
 This is millet and chillies and rice,<br>
 A supper for thee and me!</p>

<p>The child shrieked with joy, and snatched at the dark,
glancing<br>
 beads.</p>

<p>'Oho!' said the old soldier. 'Whence hadst thou that song,
despiser<br>
 of this world?'</p>

<p>'I learned it in Pathankot - sitting on a doorstep,' said the
lama<br>
 shyly. 'It is good to be kind to babes.'</p>

<p>'As I remember, before the sleep came on us, thou hadst told
me<br>
 that marriage and bearing were darkeners of the true light,<br>
 stumbling-blocks upon the Way. Do children drop from Heaven in
thy<br>
 country? Is it the Way to sing them songs?'</p>

<p>'No man is all perfect,' said the lama gravely, recoiling
the<br>
 rosary. 'Run now to thy mother, little one.'</p>

<p>'Hear him!' said the soldier to Kim. 'He is ashamed for that
he has<br>
 made a child happy. There was a very good householder lost in
thee,<br>
 my brother. Hai, child!' He threw it a pice. 'Sweetmeats are
always<br>
 sweet.' And as the little figure capered away into the
sunshine:<br>
 'They grow up and become men. Holy One, I grieve that I slept
in<br>
 the midst of thy preaching. Forgive me.'</p>

<p>'We be two old men,' said the lama. 'The fault is mine. I
listened<br>
 to thy talk of the world and its madness, and one fault led to
the<br>
 next.'</p>

<p>'Hear him! What harm do thy Gods suffer from play with a babe?
And<br>
 that song was very well sung. Let us go on and I will sing thee
the<br>
 song of Nikal Seyn before Delhi - the old song.'</p>

<p>And they fared out from the gloom of the mango tope, the old
man's<br>
 high, shrill voice ringing across the field, as wail by
long-drawn<br>
 wail he unfolded the story of Nikal Seyn [Nicholson] - the
song<br>
 that men sing in the Punjab to this day. Kim was delighted, and
the<br>
 lama listened with deep interest.</p>

<p>'Ahi! Nikal Seyn is dead - he died before Delhi! Lances of
the<br>
 North, take vengeance for Nikal Seyn.' He quavered it out to
the<br>
 end, marking the trills with the flat of his sword on the
pony's<br>
 rump.</p>

<p>'And now we come to the Big Road,' said he, after receiving
the<br>
 compliments of Kim; for the lama was markedly silent. 'It is
long<br>
 since I have ridden this way, but thy boy's talk stirred me.
See,<br>
 Holy One - the Great Road which is the backbone of all Hind.
For<br>
 the most part it is shaded, as here, with four lines of trees;
the<br>
 middle road -all hard takes the quick traffic. In the days
before<br>
 rail-carriages the Sahibs travelled up and down here in
hundreds.<br>
 Now there are only country-carts and such like. Left and right
is<br>
 the rougher road for the heavy carts - grain and cotton and
timber,<br>
 fodder, lime and hides. A man goes in safety here for at every
few<br>
 koss is a police-station. The police are thieves and
extortioners<br>
 (I myself would patrol it with cavalry - young recruits under
a<br>
 strong captain), but at least they do not suffer any rivals.
All<br>
 castes and kinds of men move here.</p>

<p>Look! Brahmins and chumars, bankers and tinkers, barbers
and<br>
 bunnias, pilgrims -and potters - all the world going and coming.
It<br>
 is to me as a river from which I am withdrawn like a log after
a<br>
 flood.'</p>

<p>And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle. It
runs<br>
 straight, bearing without crowding India's traffic for
fifteen<br>
 hundred miles - such a river of life as nowhere else exists
in<br>
 the world. They looked at the green-arched, shade-flecked
length<br>
 of it, the white breadth speckled with slow-pacing folk; and
the<br>
 two-roomed police-station opposite.</p>

<p>'Who bears arms against the law?' a constable called out<br>
 laughingly, as he caught sight of the soldier's sword. 'Are
not<br>
 the police enough to destroy evil-doers?'</p>

<p>'It was because of the police I bought it,' was the answer.
'Does<br>
 all go well in Hind?'</p>

<p>'Rissaldar Sahib, all goes well.'</p>

<p>'I am like an old tortoise, look you, who puts his head out
from<br>
 the bank and draws it in again. Ay, this is the Road of
Hindustan.<br>
 All men come by this way...'</p>

<p>'Son of a swine, is the soft part of the road meant for thee
to<br>
 scratch thy back upon? Father of all the daughters of shame
and<br>
 husband of ten thousand virtueless ones, thy mother was
devoted<br>
 to a devil, being led thereto by her mother. Thy aunts have
never<br>
 had a nose for seven generations! Thy sister - What Owl's
folly<br>
 told thee to draw thy carts across the road? A broken wheel?
Then<br>
 take a broken head and put the two together at leisure!'</p>

<p>The voice and a venomous whip-cracking came out of a pillar
of<br>
 dust fifty yards away, where a cart had broken down. A thin,
high<br>
 Kathiawar mare, with eyes and nostrils aflame, rocketed out
of<br>
 the jam, snorting and wincing as her rider bent her across
the<br>
 road in chase of a shouting man. He was tall and
grey-bearded,<br>
 sitting the almost mad beast as a piece of her, and
scientifically<br>
 lashing his victim between plunges.</p>

<p>The old man's face lit with pride. 'My child!' said he
briefly, and<br>
 strove to rein the pony's neck to a fitting arch.</p>

<p>'Am I to be beaten before the police?' cried the carter.
'Justice!<br>
 I will have Justice -'</p>

<p>'Am I to be blocked by a shouting ape who upsets ten thousand
sacks<br>
 under a young horse's nose? That is the way to ruin a mare.'</p>

<p><br>
 'He speaks truth. He speaks truth. But she follows her man
close,'<br>
 said the old man. The carter ran under the wheels of his cart
and<br>
 thence threatened all sorts of vengeance.</p>

<p>'They are strong men, thy sons,' said the policeman
serenely,<br>
 picking his teeth.</p>

<p>The horseman delivered one last vicious cut with his whip and
came<br>
 on at a canter.</p>

<p>'My father!' He reigned back ten yards and dismounted.</p>

<p>The old man was off his pony in an instant, and they embraced
as do<br>
 father and son in the East.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><br>
 Chapter 4</h2>

<p><br>
 Good Luck, she is never a lady,<br>
 But the cursedest quean alive,<br>
 Tricksy, wincing, and jady -<br>
 Kittle to lead or drive.<br>
 Greet her - she's hailing a stranger!<br>
 Meet her - she's busking to leave!<br>
 Let her alone for a shrew to the bone<br>
 And the hussy comes plucking your sleeve!<br>
 Largesse! Largesse, O Fortune!<br>
 Give or hold at your will.<br>
 If I've no care for Fortune,<br>
 Fortune must follow me still!</p>

<p>The Wishing-Caps.</p>

<p><br>
 Then, lowering their voices, they spoke together. Kim came to
rest<br>
 under a tree, but the lama tugged impatiently at his elbow.</p>

<p>'Let us go on. The River is not here.'</p>

<p>'Hai mai! Have we not walked enough for a little? Our River
will<br>
 not run away. Patience, and he will give us a dole.'</p>

<p>'This.' said the old soldier suddenly, 'is the Friend of the
Stars.<br>
 He brought me the news yesterday. Having seen the very man
Himself,<br>
 in a vision, giving orders for the war.'</p>

<p>'Hm!' said his son, all deep in his broad chest. 'He came by
a<br>
 bazar-rumour and made profit of it.'</p>

<p><br>
 His father laughed. 'At least he did not ride to me begging for
a<br>
 new charger, and the Gods know how many rupees. Are thy
brothers'<br>
 regiments also under orders?'</p>

<p>'I do not know. I took leave and came swiftly to thee in case
-'</p>

<p>'In case they ran before thee to beg. O gamblers and
spendthrifts<br>
 all! But thou hast never yet ridden in a charge. A good horse
is<br>
 needed there, truly. A good follower and a good pony also for
the<br>
 marching. Let us see - let us see.' He thrummed on the
pommel.</p>

<p>'This is no place to cast accounts in, my father. Let us go to
thy<br>
 house.'</p>

<p>'At least pay the boy, then: I have no pice with me, and he
brought<br>
 auspicious news. Ho! Friend of all the World, a war is toward
as<br>
 thou hast said.'</p>

<p>'Nay, as I know, the war,' returned Kim composedly.</p>

<p>'Eh?' said the lama, fingering his beads, all eager for the
road.</p>

<p>'My master does not trouble the Stars for hire. We brought the
news<br>
 bear witness, we brought the news, and now we go.' Kim
half-crooked<br>
 his hand at his side.</p>

<p>The son tossed a silver coin through the sunlight,
grumbling<br>
 something about beggars and jugglers. It was a four-anna piece,
and<br>
 would feed them well for days. The lama, seeing the flash of
the<br>
 metal, droned a blessing.</p>

<p>'Go thy way, Friend of all the World,' piped the old
soldier,<br>
 wheeling his scrawny mount. 'For once in all my days I have met
a<br>
 true prophet - who was not in the Army.'</p>

<p>Father and son swung round together: the old man sitting as
erect<br>
 as the younger.</p>

<p>A Punjabi constable in yellow linen trousers slouched across
the<br>
 road. He had seen the money pass.</p>

<p>'Halt!' he cried in impressive English. 'Know ye not that
there is<br>
 a takkus of two annas a head, which is four annas, on those
who<br>
 enter the Road from this side-road? It is the order of the
Sirkar,<br>
 and the money is spent for the planting of trees and the<br>
 beautification of the ways.'</p>

<p>'And the bellies of the police,' said Kim, slipping out of
arm's<br>
 reach. 'Consider for a while, man with a mud head. Think you
we<br>
 came from the nearest pond like the frog, thy father-in-law?
Hast<br>
 thou ever heard the name of thy brother?'</p>

<p>'And who was he? Leave the boy alone,' cried a senior
constable,<br>
 immensely delighted, as he squatted down to smoke his pipe in
the<br>
 veranda.</p>

<p>'He took a label from a bottle of belaitee-pani [soda-water],
and,<br>
 affixing it to a bridge, collected taxes for a month from those
who<br>
 passed, saying that it was the Sirkar's order. Then came an<br>
 Englishman and broke his head. Ah, brother, I am a town-crow,
not a<br>
 village-crow!'</p>

<p>The policeman drew back abashed, and Kim hooted at him all
down the<br>
 road.</p>

<p>'Was there ever such a disciple as I?' he cried merrily to
the<br>
 lama. 'All earth would have picked thy bones within ten mile
of<br>
 Lahore city if I had not guarded thee.'</p>

<p>'I consider in my own mind whether thou art a spirit,
sometimes, or<br>
 sometimes an evil imp,' said the lama, smiling slowly.</p>

<p>'I am thy chela.' Kim dropped into step at his side - that<br>
 indescribable gait of the long-distance tramp all the world
over.</p>

<p>'Now let us walk,' muttered the lama, and to the click of
his<br>
 rosary they walked in silence mile upon mile. The lama as
usual,<br>
 was deep in meditation, but Kim's bright eyes were open wide.
This<br>
 broad, smiling river of life, he considered, was a vast
improvement<br>
 on the cramped and crowded Lahore streets. There were new
people<br>
 and new sights at every stride - castes he knew and castes
that<br>
 were altogether out of his experience.</p>

<p>They met a troop of long-haired, strong-scented Sansis with
baskets<br>
 of lizards and other unclean food on their backs, their lean
dogs<br>
 sniffing at their heels. These people kept their own side of
the<br>
 road', moving at a quick, furtive jog-trot, and all other
castes<br>
 gave them ample room; for the Sansi is deep pollution. Behind
them,<br>
 walking wide and stiffly across the strong shadows, the memory
of<br>
 his leg-irons still on him, strode one newly released from
the<br>
 jail; his full stomach and shiny skin to prove that the
Government<br>
 fed its prisoners better than most honest men could feed<br>
 themselves. Kim knew that walk well, and made broad jest of it
as<br>
 they passed. Then an Akali, a wild-eyed, wild-haired Sikh
devotee<br>
 in the blue-checked clothes of his faith, with
polished-steel<br>
 quoits glistening on the cone of his tall blue turban,
stalked<br>
 past, returning from a visit to one of the independent Sikh
States,<br>
 where he had been singing the ancient glories of the Khalsa
to<br>
 College-trained princelings in top-boots and white-cord
breeches.<br>
 Kim was careful not to irritate that man; for the Akali's temper
is<br>
 short and his arm quick. Here and there they met or were
overtaken<br>
 by the gaily dressed crowds of whole villages turning out to
some<br>
 local fair; the women, with their babes on their hips,
walking<br>
 behind the men, the older boys prancing on sticks of
sugar-cane,<br>
 dragging rude brass models of locomotives such as they sell for
a<br>
 halfpenny, or flashing the sun into the eyes of their betters
from<br>
 cheap toy mirrors. One could see at a glance what each had
bought;<br>
 and if there were any doubt it needed only to watch the
wives<br>
 comparing, brown arm against brown arm, the newly purchased
dull<br>
 glass bracelets that come from the North-West. These
merry-makers<br>
 stepped slowly, calling one to the other and stopping to
haggle<br>
 with sweetmeat-sellers, or to make a prayer before one of
the<br>
 wayside shrines - sometimes Hindu, sometimes Mussalman - which
the<br>
 low-caste of both creeds share with beautiful impartiality. A
solid<br>
 line of blue, rising and falling like the back of a caterpillar
in<br>
 haste, would swing up through the quivering dust and trot past
to a<br>
 chorus of quick cackling. That was a gang of changars - the
women<br>
 who have taken all the embankments of all the Northern
railways<br>
 under their charge - a flat-footed, big-bosomed,
strong-limbed,<br>
 blue-petticoated clan of earth-carriers, hurrying north on news
of<br>
 a job, and wasting no time by the road. They belong to the
caste<br>
 whose men do not count, and they walked with squared elbows,<br>
 swinging hips, and heads on high, as suits women who carry
heavy<br>
 weights. A little later a marriage procession would strike into
the<br>
 Grand Trunk with music and shoutings, and a smell of marigold
and<br>
 jasmine stronger even than the reek of the dust. One could see
the<br>
 bride's litter, a blur of red and tinsel, staggering through
the<br>
 haze, while the bridegroom's bewreathed pony turned aside to
snatch<br>
 a mouthful from a passing fodder-cart. Then Kim would join
the<br>
 Kentish-fire of good wishes and bad jokes, wishing the couple
a<br>
 hundred sons and no daughters, as the saying is. Still more<br>
 interesting and more to be shouted over it was when a
strolling<br>
 juggler with some half-trained monkeys, or a panting, feeble
bear,<br>
 or a woman who tied goats' horns to her feet, and with these
danced<br>
 on a slack-rope, set the horses to shying and the women to
shrill,<br>
 long-drawn quavers of amazement.</p>

<p>The lama never raised his eyes. He did not note the
money-lender on<br>
 his goose-rumped pony, hastening along to collect the cruel<br>
 interest; or the long-shouting, deep-voiced little mob -still
in<br>
 military formation - of native soldiers on leave, rejoicing to
be<br>
 rid of their breeches and puttees, and saying the most
outrageous<br>
 things to the most respectable women in sight. Even the seller
of<br>
 Ganges-water he did not see, and Kim expected that he would
at<br>
 least buy a bottle of that precious stuff. He looked steadily
at<br>
 the ground, and strode as steadily hour after hour, his soul
busied<br>
 elsewhere. But Kim was in the seventh heaven of joy. The Grand
Trunk<br>
 at this point was built on an embankment to guard against<br>
 winter floods from the foothills, so that one walked, as it
were, a<br>
 little above the country, along a stately corridor, seeing
all<br>
 India spread out to left and right. It was beautiful to behold
the<br>
 many-yoked grain and cotton wagons crawling over the country
roads:<br>
 one could hear their axles, complaining a mile away, coming
nearer,<br>
 till with shouts and yells and bad words they climbed up the
steep<br>
 incline and plunged on to the hard main road, carter
reviling<br>
 carter. It was equally beautiful to watch the people, little
clumps<br>
 of red and blue and pink and white and saffron, turning aside to
go<br>
 to their own villages, dispersing and growing small by twos
and<br>
 threes across the level plain. Kim felt these things, though
he<br>
 could not give tongue to his feelings, and so contented
himself<br>
 with buying peeled sugar-cane and spitting the pith
generously<br>
 about his path. From time to time the lama took snuff, and at
last<br>
 Kim could endure the silence no longer.</p>

<p>'This is a good land - the land of the South!' said he. 'The
air is<br>
 good; the water is good. Eh?'</p>

<p>'And they are all bound upon the Wheel,' said the lama. 'Bound
from<br>
 life after life. To none of these has the Way been shown.' He
shook<br>
 himself back to this world.</p>

<p>'And now we have walked a weary way,' said Kim. 'Surely we
shall<br>
 soon come to a parao [a resting-place]. Shall we stay there?
Look,<br>
 the sun is sloping.'</p>

<p>'Who will receive us this evening?'</p>

<p>'That is all one. This country is full of good folk. Besides'
he<br>
 sunk his voice beneath a whisper - 'we have money.'</p>

<p>The crowd thickened as they neared the resting-place which
marked<br>
 the end of their day's journey. A line of stalls selling
very<br>
 simple food and tobacco, a stack of firewood, a police-station,
a<br>
 well, a horse-trough, a few trees, and, under them, some
trampled<br>
 ground dotted with the black ashes of old fires, are all that
mark<br>
 a parao on the Grand Trunk; if you except the beggars and the
crows<br>
 - both hungry.</p>

<p>By this time the sun was driving broad golden spokes through
the<br>
 lower branches of the mango-trees; the parakeets and doves
were<br>
 coming. home in their hundreds; the chattering, grey-backed
Seven<br>
 Sisters, talking over the day's adventures, walked back and
forth<br>
 in twos and threes almost under the feet of the travellers;
and<br>
 shufflings and scufflings in the branches showed that the bats
were<br>
 ready to go out on the night-picket. Swiftly the light
gathered<br>
 itself together, painted for an instant the faces and the<br>
 cartwheels and the bullocks' horns as red as blood. Then the
night<br>
 fell, changing the touch of the air, drawing a low, even haze,
like<br>
 a gossamer veil of blue, across the face of the country, and<br>
 bringing out, keen and distinct, the smell of wood-smoke and
cattle<br>
 and the good scent of wheaten cakes cooked on ashes. The
evening<br>
 patrol hurried out of the police-station with important
coughings<br>
 and reiterated orders; and a live charcoal ball in the cup of
a<br>
 wayside carter's hookah glowed red while Kim's eye
mechanically<br>
 watched the last flicker of the sun on the brass tweezers.</p>

<p>The life of the parao was very like that of the Kashmir Serai
on a<br>
 small scale. Kim dived into the happy Asiatic disorder which,
if<br>
 you only allow time, will bring you everything that a simple
man<br>
 needs.</p>

<p>His wants were few, because, since the lama had no caste
scruples,<br>
 cooked food from the nearest stall would serve; but, for
luxury's<br>
 sake, Kim bought a handful of dung-cakes to build a fire.
All<br>
 about, coming and going round the little flames, men cried for
oil,<br>
 or grain, or sweetmeats, or tobacco, jostling one another
while<br>
 they waited their turn at the well; and under the men's voices
you<br>
 heard from halted, shuttered carts the high squeals and giggles
of<br>
 women whose faces should not be seen in public.</p>

<p>Nowadays, well-educated natives are of opinion that when
their<br>
 womenfolk travel - and they visit a good deal - it is better
to<br>
 take them quickly by rail in a properly screened compartment;
and<br>
 that custom is spreading. But there are always those of the
old<br>
 rock who hold by the use of their forefathers; and, above
all,<br>
 there are always the old women - more conservative than the men
-<br>
 who toward the end of their days go on a pilgrimage. They,
being<br>
 withered and undesirable, do not, under certain
circumstances,<br>
 object to unveiling. After their long seclusion, during which
they<br>
 have always been in business touch with a thousand outside<br>
 interests, they love the bustle and stir of the open road,
the<br>
 gatherings at the shrines, and the infinite possibilities of
gossip<br>
 with like-minded dowagers. Very often it suits a
longsuffering<br>
 family that a strong-tongued, iron-willed old lady should
disport<br>
 herself about India in this fashion; for certainly pilgrimage
is<br>
 grateful to the Gods. So all about India, in the most remote<br>
 places, as in the most public, you find some knot of
grizzled<br>
 servitors in nominal charge of an old lady who is more or
less<br>
 curtained and hid away in a bullock-cart. Such men are staid
and<br>
 discreet, and when a European or a high-caste native is near
will<br>
 net their charge with most elaborate precautions; but in the<br>
 ordinary haphazard chances of pilgrimage the precautions are
not<br>
 taken. The old lady is, after all, intensely human, and lives
to<br>
 look upon life.</p>

<p>Kim marked down a gaily ornamented ruth or family
bullock-cart,<br>
 with a broidered canopy of two domes, like a double-humped
camel,<br>
 which had just been drawn into the par. Eight men made its
retinue,<br>
 and two of the eight were armed with rusty sabres - sure signs
that<br>
 they followed a person of distinction, for the common folk do
not<br>
 bear arms. An increasing cackle of complaints, orders, and
jests,<br>
 and what to a European would have been bad language, came
from<br>
 behind the curtains. Here was evidently a woman used to
command.</p>

<p>Kim looked over the retinue critically. Half of them were
thin-<br>
 legged, grey-bearded Ooryas from down country. The other half
were<br>
 duffle-clad, felt-hatted hillmen of the North; and that
mixture<br>
 told its own tale, even if he had not overheard the
incessant<br>
 sparring between the two divisions. The old lady was going south
on<br>
 a visit - probably to a rich relative, most probably to a
son-in-<br>
 law, who had sent up an escort as a mark of respect. The
hillmen<br>
 would be of her own people - Kulu or Kangra folk. It was
quite<br>
 clear that she was not taking her daughter down to be wedded,
or<br>
 the curtains would have been laced home and the guard would
have<br>
 allowed no one near the car. A merry and a high-spirited
dame,<br>
 thought Kim, balancing the dung-cake in one hand, the cooked
food<br>
 in the other, and piloting the lama with a nudging shoulder.<br>
 Something might be made out of the meeting. The lama would give
him<br>
 no help, but, as a conscientious chela, Kim was delighted to
beg<br>
 for two.</p>

<p>He built his fire as close to the cart as he dared, waiting
for one<br>
 of the escort to order him away. The lama dropped wearily to
the<br>
 ground, much as a heavy fruit-eating bat cowers, and returned
to<br>
 his rosary.</p>

<p>'Stand farther off, beggar!' The order was shouted in
broken<br>
 Hindustani by one of the hillmen.</p>

<p>'Huh! It is only a pahari [a hillman]', said Kim over his
shoulder.<br>
 'Since when have the hill-asses owned all Hindustan?'</p>

<p>The retort was a swift and brilliant sketch of Kim's pedigree
for<br>
 three generations.</p>

<p>'Ah!' Kim's voice was sweeter than ever, as he broke the
dung-cake<br>
 into fit pieces. 'In my country we call that the beginning of
love-talk.'</p>

<p>A harsh, thin cackle behind the curtains put the hillman on
his<br>
 mettle for a second shot.</p>

<p>'Not so bad - not so bad,' said Kim with calm. 'But have a
care, my<br>
 brother, lest we - we, I say - be minded to give a curse or so
in<br>
 return. And our curses have the knack of biting home.'</p>

<p>The Ooryas laughed; the hillman sprang forward threateningly.
The<br>
 lama suddenly raised his head, bringing his huge tam-o'-shanter
hat<br>
 into the full light of Kim's new-started fire.</p>

<p>'What is it?' said he.</p>

<p>The man halted as though struck to stone. 'I - I - am saved
from a<br>
 great sin,' he stammered.</p>

<p>'The foreigner has found him a priest at last,' whispered one
of<br>
 the Ooryas.</p>

<p>'Hai! Why is that beggar-brat not well beaten?' the old
woman<br>
 cried.</p>

<p>The hillman drew back to the cart and whispered something to
the<br>
 curtain. There was dead silence, then a muttering.</p>

<p>'This goes well,' thought Kim, pretending neither to see nor
hear.</p>

<p>'When - when - he has eaten' - the hillman fawned on Kim - 'it
- it<br>
 is requested that the Holy One will do the honour to talk to
one<br>
 who would speak to him.'</p>

<p>'After he has eaten he will sleep,' Kim returned loftily. He
could<br>
 not quite see what new turn the game had taken, but stood
resolute<br>
 to profit by it. 'Now I will get him his food.' The last
sentence,<br>
 spoken loudly, ended with a sigh as of faintness.</p>

<p>'I - I myself and the others of my people will look to that -
if it<br>
 is permitted.'</p>

<p>'It is permitted,' said Kim, more loftily than ever. 'Holy
One,<br>
 these people will bring us food.'</p>

<p>'The land is good. All the country of the South is good - a
great<br>
 and a terrible world,' mumbled the lama drowsily.</p>

<p>'Let him sleep,' said Kim, 'but look to it that we are well
fed<br>
 when he wakes. He is a very holy man.'</p>

<p>Again one of the Ooryas said something contemptuously.</p>

<p>'He is not a fakir. He is not a down-country beggar,' Kim went
on<br>
 severely, addressing the stars. 'He is the most holy of holy
men.<br>
 He is above all castes. I am his chela.'</p>

<p>'Come here!' said the flat thin voice behind the curtain; and
Kim<br>
 came, conscious that eyes he could not see were staring at him.
One<br>
 skinny brown finger heavy with rings lay on the edge of the
cart,<br>
 and the talk went this way:</p>

<p>"Who is that one?'</p>

<p>'An exceedingly holy one. He comes from far off. He comes
from<br>
 Tibet.'</p>

<p>'Where in Tibet?'</p>

<p>'From behind the snows - from a very far place. He knows the
stars;<br>
 he makes horoscopes; he reads nativities. But he does not do
this<br>
 for money. He does it for kindness and great charity. I am
his<br>
 disciple. I am called also the Friend of the Stars.'</p>

<p><br>
 'Thou art no hillman.'</p>

<p>'Ask him. He will tell thee I was sent to him from the Stars
to<br>
 show him an end to his pilgrimage.'</p>

<p>'Humph! Consider, brat, that I am an old woman and not
altogether a<br>
 fool. Lamas I know, and to these I give reverence, but thou art
no<br>
 more a lawful chela than this my finger is the pole of this
wagon.<br>
 Thou art a casteless Hindu - a bold and unblushing beggar,<br>
 attached, belike, to the Holy One for the sake of gain.'</p>

<p>'Do we not all work for gain?' Kim changed his tone promptly
to<br>
 match that altered voice. 'I have heard' - this was a bow drawn
at<br>
 a venture - 'I have heard -'</p>

<p>'What hast thou heard?' she snapped, rapping with the
finger.</p>

<p>'Nothing that I well remember, but some talk in the bazars,
which<br>
 is doubtless a lie, that even Rajahs - small Hill Rajahs -'</p>

<p>'But none the less of good Rajput blood.'</p>

<p>'Assuredly of good blood. That these even sell the more comely
of<br>
 their womenfolk for gain. Down south they sell them - to
zemindars<br>
 and such-all of Oudh.'</p>

<p>If there be one thing in the world that the small Hill Rajahs
deny<br>
 it is just this charge; but it happens to be one thing that
the<br>
 bazars believe, when they discuss the mysterious slave-traffics
of<br>
 India. The old lady explained to Kim, in a tense, indignant<br>
 whisper, precisely what manner and fashion of malignant liar
he<br>
 was. Had Kim hinted this when she was a girl, he would have
been<br>
 pommelled to death that same evening by an elephant. This
was<br>
 perfectly true.</p>

<p>'Ahai! I am only a beggar's brat, as the Eye of Beauty has
said,'<br>
 he wailed in extravagant terror.</p>

<p>'Eye of Beauty, forsooth! Who am I that thou shouldst
fling<br>
 beggar-endearments at me?' And yet she laughed at the long-<br>
 forgotten word. 'Forty years ago that might have been said, and
not<br>
 without truth. Ay. thirty years ago. But it is the fault of
this<br>
 gadding up and down Hind that a king's widow must jostle all
the<br>
 scum of the land, and be made a mock by beggars.'</p>

<p>'Great Queen,' said Kim promptly, for he heard her shaking
with<br>
 indignation, 'I am even what the Great Queen says I am; but
none<br>
 the less is my master holy. He has not yet heard the Great
Queen's<br>
 order that -' I</p>

<p>'Order? I order a Holy One - a Teacher of the Law - to come
and<br>
 speak to a woman? Never!'</p>

<p>'Pity my stupidity. I thought it was given as an order -'</p>

<p>'It was not. It was a petition. Does this make all clear?'</p>

<p>A silver coin clicked on the edge of the cart. Kim took it
and<br>
 salaamed profoundly. The old lady recognized that, as the eyes
and<br>
 the ears of the lama, he was to be propitiated.</p>

<p>'I am but the Holy One's disciple. When he has eaten perhaps
he<br>
 will come.'</p>

<p>'Oh, villain and shameless rogue!' The jewelled forefinger
shook<br>
 itself at him reprovingly; but he could hear the old lady's<br>
 chuckle.</p>

<p>'Nay, what is it?' he said, dropping into his most caressing
and<br>
 confidential tone - the one, he well knew, that few could
resist.<br>
 'Is - is there any need of a son in thy family? Speak freely,
for<br>
 we priests -' That last was a direct plagiarism from a fakir by
the<br>
 Taksali Gate.</p>

<p>'We priests! Thou art not yet old enough to -' She checked the
joke<br>
 with another laugh. 'Believe me, now and again, we women, O
priest,<br>
 think of other matters than sons. Moreover, my daughter has
borne<br>
 her man-child.'</p>

<p>'Two arrows in the quiver are better than one; and three are
better<br>
 still.' Kim quoted the proverb with a meditative cough,
looking<br>
 discreetly earthward.</p>

<p>'True - oh, true. But perhaps that will come. Certainly those
down-<br>
 country Brahmins are utterly useless. I sent gifts and monies
and<br>
 gifts again to them, and they prophesied.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' drawled Kim, with infinite contempt, 'they prophesied!'
A<br>
 professional could have done no better.</p>

<p>'And it was not till I remembered my own Gods that my prayers
were<br>
 heard. I chose an auspicious hour, and - perhaps thy Holy One
has<br>
 heard of the Abbot of the Lung-Cho lamassery. It was to him I
put<br>
 the matter, and behold in the due time all came about as I
desired.<br>
 The Brahmin in the house of the father of my daughter's son
has<br>
 since said that it was through his prayers - which is a
little<br>
 error that I will explain to him when we reach our journey's
end.<br>
 And so afterwards I go to Buddh Gaya, to make shraddha for
the<br>
 father of my children.'</p>

<p>'Thither go we.'</p>

<p>'Doubly auspicious,' chirruped the old lady. 'A second son
at<br>
 least!'</p>

<p>'O Friend of all the World!' The lama had waked, and, simply
as a<br>
 child bewildered in a strange bed, called for Kim.</p>

<p>'I come! I come, Holy One!' He dashed to the fire, where he
found<br>
 the lama already surrounded by dishes of food, the hillmen
visibly<br>
 adoring him and the Southerners looking sourly.</p>

<p>'Go back! Withdraw!' Kim cried. 'Do we eat publicly like
dogs?'<br>
 They finished the meal in silence, each turned a little from
the<br>
 other, and Kim topped it with a native-made cigarette.</p>

<p>'Have I not said an hundred times that the South is a good
land?<br>
 Here is a virtuous and high-born widow of a Hill Rajah on<br>
 pilgrimage, she says, to Buddha Gay. She it is sends us
those<br>
 dishes; and when thou art well rested she would speak to
thee.'</p>

<p>'Is this also thy work?' The lama dipped deep into his
snuff-gourd.</p>

<p>'Who else watched over thee since our wonderful journey
began?'<br>
 Kim's eyes danced in his head as he blew the rank smoke through
his<br>
 nostrils and stretched him on the dusty ground. 'Have I failed
to<br>
 oversee thy comforts, Holy One?'</p>

<p>'A blessing on thee.' The lama inclined his solemn head. 'I
have<br>
 known many men in my so long life, and disciples not a few. But
to<br>
 none among men, if so be thou art woman-born, has my heart gone
out<br>
 as it has to thee - thoughtful, wise, and courteous; but
something<br>
 of a small imp.'</p>

<p>'And I have never seen such a priest as thou.' Kim considered
the<br>
 benevolent yellow face wrinkle by wrinkle. 'It is less than
three<br>
 days since we took the road together, and it is as though it
were a<br>
 hundred years.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps in a former life it was permitted that I should
have<br>
 rendered thee some service. Maybe' - he smiled -'I freed thee
from<br>
 a trap; or, having caught thee on a hook in the days when I
was<br>
 not enlightened, cast thee back into the river.'</p>

<p>'Maybe,' said Kim quietly. He had heard this sort of
speculation<br>
 again and again, from the mouths of many whom the English would
not<br>
 consider imaginative. 'Now, as regards that</p>

<p>women in the bullock-cart I think she needs a second son for
her<br>
 daughter.'</p>

<p>'That is no part of the Way,' sighed the lama. 'But at least
she is<br>
 from the Hills. Ah, the Hills, and the snow of the Hills!'</p>

<p>He rose and stalked to the cart. Kim would have given his ears
to<br>
 come too, but the lama did not invite him; and the few words
he<br>
 caught were in an unknown tongue, for they spoke some common
speech<br>
 of the mountains. The woman seemed to ask questions which the
lama<br>
 turned over in his mind before answering. Now and again he
heard<br>
 the singsong cadence of a Chinese quotation. It was a
strange<br>
 picture that Kim watched between drooped eyelids. The lama,
very<br>
 straight and erect, the deep folds of his yellow clothing
slashed<br>
 with black in the light of the parao fires precisely as a
knotted<br>
 tree-trunk is slashed with the shadows of the low sun, addressed
a<br>
 tinsel and lacquered ruth which burned like a many-coloured
jewel<br>
 in the same uncertain light. The patterns on the gold-worked<br>
 curtains ran up and down, melting and reforming as the folds
shook<br>
 and quivered to the night wind; and when the talk grew more
earnest<br>
 the jewelled forefinger snapped out little sparks of light
between<br>
 the embroideries. Behind the cart was a wall of uncertain
darkness<br>
 speckled with little flames and alive with half-caught forms
and<br>
 faces and shadows. The voices of early evening had settled down
to<br>
 one soothing hum whose deepest note was the steady chumping of
the<br>
 bullocks above their chopped straw, and whose highest was
the<br>
 tinkle of a Bengali dancing-girl's sitar. Most men had eaten
and<br>
 pulled deep at their gurgling, grunting hookahs, which in
full<br>
 blast sound like bull-frogs.</p>

<p>At last the lama returned. A hillman walked behind him with
a<br>
 wadded cotton-quilt and spread it carefully by the fire.</p>

<p>'She deserves ten thousand grandchildren,' thought Kim. 'None
the<br>
 less, but for me, those gifts would not have come.'</p>

<p>'A virtuous woman - and a wise one.' The lama slackened off,
joint<br>
 by joint, like a slow camel. 'The world is full of charity to
those<br>
 who follow the Way.' He flung a fair half of the quilt over
Kim.<br>
 'And what said she?' Kim rolled up in his share of it.</p>

<p>'She asked me many questions and propounded many problems -
the<br>
 most of which were idle tales which she had heard from
devil-<br>
 serving priests who pretend to follow the Way. Some I answered,
and<br>
 some I said were foolish. Many wear the Robe, but few keep
the<br>
 Way.'</p>

<p>'True. That is true.' Kim used the thoughtful, conciliatory
tone of<br>
 those who wish to draw confidences.</p>

<p>'But by her lights she is most right-minded. She desires
greatly<br>
 that we should go with her to Buddh Gaya; her road being ours,
as I<br>
 understand, for many days' journey to the southward.'</p>

<p>'And?'</p>

<p>'Patience a little. To this I said that my Search came before
all<br>
 things. She had heard many foolish legends, but this great truth
of<br>
 my River she had never heard. Such are the priests of the
lower<br>
 hills! She knew the Abbot of Lung-Cho, but she did not know of
my<br>
 River - nor the tale of the Arrow.'</p>

<p>'And?'</p>

<p>'I spoke therefore of the Search, and of the Way, and of
matters<br>
 that were profitable; she desiring only that I should accompany
her<br>
 and make prayer for a second son.'</p>

<p>'Aha! "We women" do not think of anything save children,' said
Kim<br>
 sleepily.</p>

<p>'Now, since our roads run together for a while, I do not see
that<br>
 we in any way depart from our Search if so be we accompany her -
at<br>
 least as far as - I have forgotten the name of the city.'</p>

<p>'Ohe!' said Kim, turning and speaking in a sharp whisper to
one of<br>
 the Ooryas a few yards away. 'Where is your master's house?'</p>

<p>'A little behind Saharunpore, among the fruit gardens.' He
named<br>
 the village.</p>

<p>'That was the place,' said the lama. 'So far, at least, we can
go<br>
 with her.'</p>

<p>'Flies go to carrion,' said the Oorya, in an abstracted
voice.</p>

<p>'For the sick cow a crow; for the sick man a Brahmin.' Kim
breathed<br>
 the proverb impersonally to the shadow-tops of the trees
overhead.</p>

<p>The Oorya grunted and held his peace.</p>

<p>'So then we go with her, Holy One?'</p>

<p>'Is there any reason against? I can still step aside and try
all<br>
 the rivers that the road overpasses. She desires that I
should<br>
 come. She very greatly desires it.'</p>

<p>Kim stifled a laugh in the quilt. When once that imperious old
lady<br>
 had recovered from her natural awe of a lama he thought it
probable<br>
 that she would be worth listening to.</p>

<p>He was nearly asleep when the lama suddenly quoted a proverb:
'The<br>
 husbands of the talkative have a great reward hereafter.' Then
Kim<br>
 heard him snuff thrice, and dozed off, still laughing.</p>

<p>The diamond-bright dawn woke men and crows and bullocks
together.<br>
 Kim sat up and yawned, shook himself, and thrilled with
delight.<br>
 This was seeing the world in real truth; this was life as he
would<br>
 have it - bustling and shouting, the buckling of belts, and
beating<br>
 of bullocks and creaking of wheels, lighting of fires and
cooking<br>
 of food, and new sights at every turn of the approving eye.
The<br>
 morning mist swept off in a whorl of silver, the parrots shot
away<br>
 to some distant river in shrieking green hosts: all the
well-wheels<br>
 within ear-shot went to work. India was awake, and Kim was in
the<br>
 middle of it, more awake and more excited than anyone, chewing
on a<br>
 twig that he would presently use as a toothbrush; for he
borrowed<br>
 right- and left-handedly from all the customs of the country
he<br>
 knew and loved. There was no need to worry about food - no need
to<br>
 spend a cowrie at the crowded stalls. He was the disciple of a
holy<br>
 man annexed by a strong-willed old lady. All things would be<br>
 prepared for them, and when they were respectfully invited so to
do<br>
 they would sit and eat. For the rest - Kim giggled here as
he<br>
 cleaned his teeth - his hostess would rather heighten the
enjoyment<br>
 of the road. He inspected her bullocks critically, as they came
up<br>
 grunting and blowing under the yokes. If they went too fast -it
was<br>
 not likely - there would be a pleasant seat for himself along
the<br>
 pole; the lama would sit beside the driver. The escort, of
course,<br>
 would walk. The old lady, equally of course, would talk a
great<br>
 deal, and by what he had heard that conversation would not
lack<br>
 salt. She was already ordering, haranguing, rebuking, and, it
must<br>
 be said, cursing her servants for delays.</p>

<p>'Get her her pipe. In the name of the Gods, get her her pipe
and<br>
 stop her ill-omened mouth,' cried an Oorya, tying up his
shapeless<br>
 bundles of bedding. 'She and the parrots are alike. They screech
in<br>
 the dawn.'</p>

<p>'The lead-bullocks! Hai! Look to the lead-bullocks!' They
were<br>
 backing and wheeling as a grain-cart's axle caught them by
the<br>
 horns. "Son of an owl, where dost thou go?' This to the
grinning<br>
 carter.</p>

<p>'Ai! Yai! Yai! That within there is the Queen of Delhi going
to<br>
 pray for a son,' the man called back over his high load. 'Room
for<br>
 the Queen of Delhi and her Prime Minister the grey monkey
climbing<br>
 up his own sword!' Another cart loaded with bark for a
down-country<br>
 tannery followed close behind, and its driver added a few<br>
 compliments as the ruth-bullocks backed and backed again.</p>

<p>&gt;From behind the shaking curtains came one volley of
invective. It<br>
 did not last long, but in kind and quality, in blistering,
biting<br>
 appropriateness, it was beyond anything that even Kim had heard.
He<br>
 could see the carter's bare chest collapse with amazement, as
the<br>
 man salaamed reverently to the voice, leaped from the pole,
and<br>
 helped the escort haul their volcano on to the main road. Here
the<br>
 voice told him truthfully what sort of wife he had wedded, and
what<br>
 she was doing in his absence.</p>

<p>'Oh, shabash!' murmured Kim, unable to contain himself, as the
man<br>
 slunk away.</p>

<p>'Well done, indeed? It is a shame and a scandal that a poor
woman<br>
 may not go to make prayer to her Gods except she be jostled
and<br>
 insulted by all the refuse of Hindustan - that she must eat
gali<br>
 [abuse] as men eat ghi. But I have yet a wag left to my tongue -
a<br>
 word or two well spoken that serves the occasion. And still am
I<br>
 without my tobacco! Who is the one-eyed and luckless son of
shame<br>
 that has not yet prepared my pipe?'</p>

<p>It was hastily thrust in by a hillman, and a trickle of thick
smoke<br>
 from each corner of the curtains showed that peace was
restored.</p>

<p>If Kim had walked proudly the day before, disciple of a holy
man,<br>
 today he paced with tenfold pride in the train of a
semi-royal<br>
 procession, with a recognized place under the patronage of an
old<br>
 lady of charming manners and infinite resource. The escort,
their<br>
 heads tied up native-fashion, fell in on either side the
cart,<br>
 shuffling enormous clouds of dust.</p>

<p><br>
 The lama and Kim walked a little to one side; Kim chewing his
stick<br>
 of sugarcane, and making way for no one under the status of
a<br>
 priest. They could hear the old lady's tongue clack as steadily
as<br>
 a rice-husker. She bade the escort tell her what was going on
on<br>
 the road; and so soon as they were clear of the parao she
flung<br>
 back the curtains and peered out, her veil a third across her
face.<br>
 Her men did not eye her directly when she addressed them, and
thus<br>
 the proprieties were more or less observed.</p>

<p>A dark, sallowish District Superintendent of Police,
faultlessly<br>
 uniformed, an Englishman, trotted by on a tired horse, and,
seeing<br>
 from her retinue what manner of person she was, chaffed her.</p>

<p>'O mother,' he cried, 'do they do this in the zenanas? Suppose
an<br>
 Englishman came by and saw that thou hats no nose?'</p>

<p>'What?' she shrilled back. 'Thine own mother has no nose? Why
say<br>
 so, then, on the open road?'</p>

<p>It was a fair counter. The Englishman threw up his hand with
the<br>
 gesture of a man hit at sword-play. She laughed and nodded.</p>

<p>'Is this a face to tempt virtue aside?. She withdrew all her
veil<br>
 and stared at him.</p>

<p>It was by no means lovely, but as the man gathered up his
reins he<br>
 called it a Moon of Paradise, a Disturber of Integrity, and a
few<br>
 other fantastic epithets which doubled her up with mirth.</p>

<p>'That is a nut-cut [rogue],' she said. 'All police-constables
are<br>
 nut-cuts; but the police-wallahs are the worst. Hai, my son,
thou<br>
 hast never learned all that since thou camest from Belait
[Europe].<br>
 Who suckled thee?'</p>

<p>'A pahareen - a hillwoman of Dalhousie, my mother. Keep thy
beauty<br>
 under a shade - O Dispenser of Delights,' and he was gone.</p>

<p>'These be the sort' - she took a fine judicial tone, and
stuffed<br>
 her mouth with pan - 'These be the sort to oversee justice.
They<br>
 know the land and the customs of the land, The others, all new
from<br>
 Europe, suckled by white women and learning our tongues from
books,<br>
 are worse than the pestilence. They do harm to Kings.' Then
she<br>
 told a long, long tale to the world at large, of an ignorant
young<br>
 policeman who had disturbed some small Hill Rajah, a- ninth
cousin<br>
 of her own, in the matter of a trivial land-case, winding up
with a<br>
 quotation from a work by no means devotional.</p>

<p>Then her mood changed, and she bade one of the escort ask
whether<br>
 the lama would walk alongside and discuss matters of religion.
So<br>
 Kim dropped back into the dust and returned to his sugar-cane.
For<br>
 an hour or more the lama's tam-o'shanter showed like a moon
through<br>
 the haze; and, from all he heard, Kim gathered that the old
woman<br>
 wept. One of the Ooryas half apologized for his rudeness
overnight,<br>
 saying that he had never known his mistress of so bland a
temper,<br>
 and he ascribed it to the presence of the strange priest.<br>
 Personally, he believed in Brahmins, though, like all natives,
he<br>
 was acutely aware of their cunning and their greed. Still,
when<br>
 Brahmins but irritated with begging demands the mother of
his<br>
 master's wife, and when she sent them away so angry that
they<br>
 cursed the whole retinue (which was the real reason of the
second<br>
 off-side bullock going lame, and of the pole breaking the
night<br>
 before), he was prepared to accept any priest of any other<br>
 denomination in or out of India. To this Kim assented with
wise<br>
 nods, and bade the Oorya observe that the lama took no money,
and<br>
 that the cost of his and Kim's food would be repaid a hundred
times<br>
 in the good luck that would attend the caravan henceforward.
He<br>
 also told stories of Lahore city, and sang a song or two which
made<br>
 the escort laugh. As a town-mouse well acquainted with the
latest<br>
 songs by the most fashionable composers - they are women for
the<br>
 most part - Kim had a distinct advantage over men from a
little<br>
 fruit-village behind Saharunpore, but he let that advantage
be<br>
 inferred.</p>

<p>At noon they turned aside to eat, and the meal was good,
plentiful,<br>
 and well-served on plates of clean leaves, in decency, out of
drift<br>
 of the dust. They gave the scraps to certain beggars, that
all<br>
 requirements might be fulfilled, and sat down to a long,
luxurious<br>
 smoke. The old lady had retreated behind her curtains, but
mixed<br>
 most freely in the talk, her servants arguing with and<br>
 contradicting her as servants do throughout the East. She
compared<br>
 the cool and the pines of the Kangra and Kulu hills with the
dust<br>
 and the mangoes of the South; she told a tale of some old
local<br>
 Gods at the edge of her husband's territory; she roundly abused
the<br>
 tobacco which she was then smoking, reviled all Brahmins,
and<br>
 speculated without reserve on the coming of many grandsons.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><br>
 Here come I to my own again<br>
 Fed, forgiven, and known again<br>
 Claimed by bone of my bone again,<br>
 And sib to flesh of my flesh!<br>
 The fatted calf is dressed for me,<br>
 But the husks have greater zest for me ...<br>
 I think my pigs will be best for me,<br>
 So I'm off to the styes afresh.</p>

<p>The Prodigal Son.</p>

<p><br>
 Once more the lazy, string-tied, shuffling procession got
under<br>
 way, and she slept till they reached the next halting-stage. It
was<br>
 a very short march, and time lacked an hour to sundown, so Kim
cast<br>
 about for means of amusement.</p>

<p>'But why not sit and rest?' said one of the escort. 'Only
the<br>
 devils and the English walk to and fro without reason.'</p>

<p>'Never make friends with the Devil, a Monkey, or a Boy. No
man<br>
 knows what they will do next,' said his fellow.</p>

<p><br>
 Kim turned a scornful back - he did not want to hear the old
story<br>
 how the Devil played with the boys and repented of it and
walked<br>
 idly across country.</p>

<p>The lama strode after him. All that day, whenever they passed
a<br>
 stream, he had turned aside to look at it, but in no case had
he<br>
 received any warning that he had found his River. Insensibly,
too,<br>
 the comfort of speaking to someone in a reasonable tongue,' and
of<br>
 being properly considered and respected as her spiritual adviser
by<br>
 a well-born woman, had weaned his thoughts a little from the<br>
 Search. And further, he was prepared to spend serene years in
his<br>
 quest; having nothing of the white manis impatience, but a
great<br>
 faith.</p>

<p>'Where goest thou?' he called after Kim.</p>

<p>'Nowhither - it was a small march, and all this'- Kim waved
his<br>
 hands abroad - 'is new to me.'</p>

<p>'She is beyond question a wise and a discerning woman. But it
is<br>
 hard to meditate when -'</p>

<p>'All women are thus.' Kim spoke as might have Solomon.</p>

<p>'Before the lamassery was a broad platform,' the lama
muttered,<br>
 looping up the well-worn rosary, 'of stone. On that I have left
the<br>
 marks of my feet - pacing to and fro with these.'</p>

<p>He clicked the beads, and began the 'Om mane pudme hum's of
his<br>
 devotion; grateful for the cool, the quiet, and the absence
of<br>
 dust.</p>

<p>One thing after another drew Kim's idle eye across the plain.
There<br>
 was no purpose in his wanderings, except that the build of the
huts<br>
 near by seemed new, and he wished to investigate.</p>

<p>They came out on a broad tract of grazing-ground, brown and
purple<br>
 in the afternoon light, with a heavy clump of mangoes in the<br>
 centre. It struck Kim as curious that no shrine stood in so<br>
 eligible a spot: the boy was observing as any priest for
these<br>
 things. Far across the plain walked side by side four men,
made<br>
 small by the distance. He looked intently under his curved
palms<br>
 and caught the sheen of brass.</p>

<p>'Soldiers. White soldiers!' said he. 'Let us see.'</p>

<p>'It is always soldiers when thou and I go out alone together.
But I<br>
 have never seen the white soldiers.'</p>

<p>'They do no harm except when they are drunk. Keep behind
this<br>
 tree.'</p>

<p>They stepped behind the thick trunks in the cool dark of the
mango-<br>
 tope. Two little figures halted; the other two came forward<br>
 uncertainly. They were the advance-party of a regiment on
the<br>
 march, sent out, as usual, to mark the camp. They bore
five-foot<br>
 sticks with fluttering flags, and called to each other as
they<br>
 spread over the flat earth.</p>

<p>At last they entered the mango-grove, walking heavily.</p>

<p>'It's here or hereabouts - officers' tents under the trees, I
take<br>
 it, an' the rest of us can stay outside. Have they marked out
for<br>
 the baggage-wagons behind?'</p>

<p>They cried again to their comrades in the distance, and the
rough<br>
 answer came back faint and mellowed.</p>

<p>'Shove the flag in here, then,' said one.</p>

<p>'What do they prepare?' said the lama, wonderstruck. 'This is
a<br>
 great and terrible world. What is the device on the flag?'</p>

<p>A soldier thrust a stave within a few feet of them,
grunted<br>
 discontentedly, pulled it up again, conferred with his
companion,<br>
 who looked up and down the shaded cave of greenery, and
returned<br>
 it.</p>

<p>Kim stared with all his eyes, his breath coming short and
sharp<br>
 between his teeth. The soldiers stamped off into the
sunshine.</p>

<p>'O Holy One!' he gasped. 'My horoscope! The drawing in the
dust by<br>
 the priest at Umballa! Remember what he said. First come two
-<br>
 ferashes - to make all things ready - in a dark place, as it
is<br>
 always at the beginning of a vision.'</p>

<p>'But this is not vision,' said the lama. 'It is the
world's<br>
 Illusion, and no more.'</p>

<p>'And after them comes the Bull - the Red Bull on the green
field.<br>
 Look! It is he!'</p>

<p>He pointed to the flag that was snap snapping in the evening
breeze<br>
 not ten feet away. It was no more than an ordinary camp
marking-<br>
 flag; but the regiment, always punctilious in matters of
millinery,<br>
 had charged it with the regimental device, the Red Bull, which
is<br>
 the crest of the Mavericks - the great Red Bull on a background
of<br>
 Irish green.</p>

<p>'I see, and now I remember.' said the lama. 'Certainly it is
thy<br>
 Bull. Certainly, also, the two men came to make all ready.'</p>

<p>'They are soldiers - white soldiers. What said the priest?
"The<br>
 sign over against the Bull is the sign of War and armed men."
Holy<br>
 One, this thing touches my Search.'</p>

<p>'True. It is true.' The lama stared fixedly at the device
that<br>
 flamed like a ruby in the dusk. 'The priest at Umballa said
that<br>
 thine was the sign of War.'</p>

<p>'What is to do now?'</p>

<p>'Wait. Let us wait.'</p>

<p>'Even now the darkness clears" said Kim. It was only natural
that<br>
 the descending sun should at last strike through the
tree-trunks,<br>
 across the grove, filling it with mealy gold light for a few<br>
 minutes; but to Kim it was the crown of the Umballa
Brahmin's<br>
 prophecy.</p>

<p>'Hark!' said the lama. 'One beats a drum - far off!'</p>

<p>At first the sound, carrying diluted through the still
air,<br>
 resembled the beating of an artery in the head. Soon a
sharpness<br>
 was added.</p>

<p>'Ah! The music,' Kim explained. He knew the sound of a
regimental<br>
 band, but it amazed the lama.</p>

<p>At the far end of the plain a heavy, dusty column crawled in
sight.<br>
 Then the wind brought the tune:</p>

<p>We crave your condescension<br>
 To tell you what we know<br>
 Of marching in the Mulligan Guards<br>
 To Sligo Port below!</p>

<p>Here broke in the shrill-tongued fifes:</p>

<p>We shouldered arms,<br>
 We marched - we marched away.<br>
 &gt;From Phoenix Park<br>
 We marched to Dublin Bay.<br>
 The drums and the fifes,<br>
 Oh, sweetly they did play,<br>
 As we marched - marched - marched - with the<br>
 Mulligan Guards!</p>

<p>It was the band of the Mavericks playing the regiment to camp;
for<br>
 the men were route-marching with their baggage. The rippling
column<br>
 swung into the level - carts behind it divided left and right,
ran<br>
 about like an ant-hill, and ...</p>

<p>'But this is sorcery!' said the lama.</p>

<p>The plain dotted itself with tents that seemed to rise, all
spread,<br>
 from the carts. Another rush of men invaded the grove, pitched
a<br>
 huge tent in silence, ran up yet eight or nine more by the side
of<br>
 it, unearthed cooking-pots, pans, and bundles, which were
taken<br>
 possession of by a crowd of native servants; and behold the
mango-<br>
 tope turned into an orderly town as they watched!</p>

<p>'Let us go,' said the lama, sinking back afraid, as the
fires<br>
 twinkled and white officers with jingling swords stalked into
the<br>
 Mess-tent.</p>

<p>'Stand back in the shadow. No one can see beyond the light of
a<br>
 fire,' said Kim, his eyes still on the flag. He had never
before<br>
 watched the routine of a seasoned regiment pitching camp in
thirty<br>
 minutes.</p>

<p>'Look! look! look!' clucked the lama. 'Yonder comes a priest.'
It<br>
 was Bennett, the Church of England Chaplain of the regiment,<br>
 limping in dusty black. One of his flock had made some rude
remarks<br>
 about the Chaplain's mettle; and to abash him Bennett had
marched<br>
 step by step with the men that day. The black dress, gold cross
on<br>
 the watch-chain, the hairless face, and the soft, black
wideawake<br>
 hat would have marked him as a holy man anywhere in all India.
He<br>
 dropped into a camp-chair by the door of the Mess-tent and slid
off<br>
 his boots. Three or four officers gathered round him, laughing
and<br>
 joking over his exploit.</p>

<p>'The talk of white men is wholly lacking in dignity,' said
the<br>
 lama, who judged only by tone. 'But I considered the countenance
of<br>
 that priest and I think he is learned. Is it likely that he
will<br>
 understand our talk? I would talk to him of my Search.'</p>

<p>'Never speak to a white man till he is fed,' said Kim, quoting
a<br>
 well-known proverb. 'They will eat now, and - and I do not
think<br>
 they are good to beg from. Let us go back to the
resting-place.<br>
 After we have eaten we will come again. It certainly was a Red
Bull<br>
 - my Red Bull.'</p>

<p>They were both noticeably absent-minded when the old lady's
retinue<br>
 set their meal before them; so none broke their reserve, for it
is<br>
 not lucky to annoy guests.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Kim, picking his teeth, 'we will return to that
place;<br>
 but thou, O Holy One, must wait a little way off, because thy
feet<br>
 are heavier than mine and I am anxious to see more of that
Red<br>
 Bull.'</p>

<p>'But how canst thou understand the talk? Walk slowly. The road
is<br>
 dark,' the lama replied uneasily.</p>

<p>Kim put the question aside. 'I marked a place near to the
trees,'<br>
 said he, 'where thou canst sit till I call. Nay,' as the lama
made<br>
 some sort of protest, 'remember this is my Search - the Search
for<br>
 my Red Bull. The sign in the Stars was not for thee. I know
a<br>
 little of the customs of white soldiers, and I always desire to
see<br>
 some new things.'</p>

<p>'What dost thou not know of this world?' The lama squatted<br>
 obediently in a little hollow of the ground not a hundred
yards<br>
 from the hump of the mango-trees dark against the
star-powdered<br>
 sky.</p>

<p>'Stay till I call.' Kim flitted into the dusk. He knew that in
all<br>
 probability there would be sentries round the camp, and smiled
to<br>
 himself as he heard the thick boots of one. A boy who can
dodge<br>
 over the roofs of Lahore city on a moonlight night, using
every<br>
 little patch and corner of darkness to discomfit his pursuer,
is<br>
 not likely to be checked by a line of well-trained soldiers.
He<br>
 paid them the compliment of crawling between a couple, and,
running<br>
 and halting, crouching and dropping flat, worked his way toward
the<br>
 lighted Mess-tent where, close pressed behind the mango-tree,
he<br>
 waited till some chance word should give him a returnable
lead.</p>

<p>The one thing now in his mind was further information as to
the Red<br>
 Bull. For aught he knew, and Kim's limitations were as curious
and<br>
 sudden as his expansions, the men, the nine hundred thorough
devils<br>
 of his father's prophecy, might pray to the beast after dark,
as<br>
 Hindus pray to the Holy Cow. That at least would be entirely
right<br>
 and logical, and the padre with the gold cross would be
therefore<br>
 the man to consult in the matter. On the other hand,
remembering<br>
 sober-faced padres whom he had avoided in Lahore city, the
priest<br>
 might be an inquisitive nuisance who would bid him learn. But
had<br>
 it not been proven at Umballa that his sign in the high
heavens<br>
 portended War and armed men? Was he not the Friend of the Stars
as<br>
 well as of all the World, crammed to the teeth with dreadful<br>
 secrets? Lastly - and firstly as the undercurrent of all his
quick<br>
 thoughts -this adventure, though he did not know the English
word,<br>
 was a stupendous lark - a delightful continuation of his old<br>
 flights across the housetops, as well as the fulfilment of
sublime<br>
 prophecy. He lay belly-flat and wriggled towards the
Mess-tent<br>
 door, a hand on the amulet round his neck.</p>

<p>It was as he suspected. The Sahibs prayed to their God; for in
the<br>
 centre of the Mess-table - its sole ornament when they were on
the<br>
 line of march - stood a golden bull fashioned from old-time loot
of<br>
 the Summer Palace at Pekin - a red-gold bull with lowered
head,<br>
 ramping upon a field of Irish green. To him the Sahibs held
out<br>
 their glasses and cried aloud confusedly.</p>

<p>Now the Reverend Arthur Bennett always left Mess after that
toast,<br>
 and being rather tired by his march his movements were more
abrupt<br>
 than usual. Kim, with slightly raised head, was still staring
at<br>
 his totem on the table, when the Chaplain stepped on his
right<br>
 shoulder-blade. Kim flinched under the leather, and, rolling<br>
 sideways, brought down the Chaplain, who, ever a man of
action,<br>
 caught him by the throat and nearly choked the life out of him.
Kim<br>
 then kicked him desperately in the stomach. Mr Bennett gasped
and<br>
 doubled up, but without relaxing his grip, rolled over again,
and<br>
 silently hauled Kim to his own tent. The Mavericks were
incurable<br>
 practical jokers; and it occurred to the Englishman that
silence<br>
 was best till he had made complete inquiry.</p>

<p>'Why, it's a boy!' he said, as he drew his prize under the
light of<br>
 the tent-pole lantern, then shaking him severely cried: 'What
were<br>
 you doing? You're a thief. Choor? Mallum?' His Hindustani was
very<br>
 limited, and the ruffled and disgusted Kim intended to keep to
the<br>
 character laid down for him. As he recovered his breath he
was<br>
 inventing a beautifully plausible tale of his relations to
some<br>
 scullion, and at the same time keeping a keen eye on and a
little<br>
 under the Chaplain's left arm-pit. The chance came; he ducked
for<br>
 the doorway, but a long arm shot out and clutched at his
neck,<br>
 snapping the amulet-string and closing on the amulet.</p>

<p>'Give it me. O, give it me. Is it lost? Give me the
papers.'</p>

<p>The words were in English - the tinny, saw-cut English of
the<br>
 native-bred, and the Chaplain jumped.</p>

<p>'A scapular,' said he, opening his hand. 'No, some sort of
heathen<br>
 charm. Why - why, do you speak English? Little boys who steal
are<br>
 beaten. You know that?'</p>

<p>'I do not - I did not steal.' Kim danced in agony like a
terrier at<br>
 a lifted stick. 'Oh, give it me. It is my charm. Do not thieve
it<br>
 from me.'</p>

<p>The Chaplain took no heed, but, going to the tent door,
called<br>
 aloud. A fattish, clean-shaven man appeared.</p>

<p>'I want your advice, Father Victor,' said Bennett. 'I found
this<br>
 boy in the dark outside the Mess-tent. Ordinarily, I should
have<br>
 chastised him and let him go, because I believe him to be a
thief.<br>
 But it seems he talks English, and he attaches some sort of
value<br>
 to a charm round his neck. I thought perhaps you might help
me.'</p>

<p>Between himself and the Roman Catholic Chaplain of the
Irish<br>
 contingent lay, as Bennett believed, an unbridgeable gulf, but
it<br>
 was noticeable that whenever the Church of England dealt with
a<br>
 human problem she was very likely to call in the Church of
Rome.<br>
 Bennett's official abhorrence of the Scarlet Woman and all her
ways<br>
 was only equalled by his private respect for Father Victor.</p>

<p>'A thief talking English, is it? Let's look at his charm. No,
it's<br>
 not a scapular, Bennett.' He held out his hand.</p>

<p>'But have we any right to open it? A sound whipping -'</p>

<p>'I did not thieve,' protested Kim. 'You have hit me kicks all
over<br>
 my body. Now give me my charm and I will go away.'</p>

<p>'Not quite so fast. We'll look first,' said Father Victor,<br>
 leisurely rolling out poor Kimball O'Hara's 'ne varietur'<br>
 parchment, his clearance-certificate, and Kim's baptismal<br>
 certificate. On this last O'Hara - with some confused idea that
he<br>
 was doing wonders for his son - had scrawled scores of times:
'Look<br>
 after the boy. Please look after the boy' - signing his name
and<br>
 regimental number in full.</p>

<p>'Powers of Darkness below!" said Father Victor, passing all
over to<br>
 Mr Bennett. 'Do you know what these things are?'</p>

<p>'Yes.' said Kim. 'They are mine, and I want to go away.'</p>

<p>'I do not quite understand,' said Mr Bennett. 'He probably
brought<br>
 them on purpose. It may be a begging trick of some kind.'</p>

<p>'I never saw a beggar less anxious to stay with his company,
then.<br>
 There's the makings of a gay mystery here. Ye believe in<br>
 Providence, Bennett?'</p>

<p>'I hope so.'</p>

<p>'Well, I believe in miracles, so it comes to the same thing.
Powers<br>
 of Darkness! Kimball O'Hara! And his son! But then he's a
native,<br>
 and I saw Kimball married myself to Annie Shott. How long have
you<br>
 had these things, boy?'</p>

<p>'Ever since I was a little baby.'</p>

<p>Father Victor stepped forward quickly and opened the front of
Kim's<br>
 upper garment. 'You see, Bennett, he's not very black. What's
your<br>
 name?'</p>

<p>'Kim.'</p>

<p>'Or Kimball?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps. Will you let me go away?'</p>

<p>'What else?'</p>

<p>'They call me Kim Rishti ke. That is Kim of the Rishti.'</p>

<p>'What is that - "Rishti"?'</p>

<p>'Eye-rishti - that was the Regiment - my father's.'</p>

<p>'Irish - oh, I see.'</p>

<p>'Yess. That was how my father told me. My father, he has
lived.'</p>

<p>'Has lived where?'</p>

<p>'Has lived. Of course he is dead - gone-out.'</p>

<p>'Oh! That's your abrupt way of putting it, is it?'</p>

<p>Bennett interrupted. 'It is possible I have done the boy
an<br>
 injustice. He is certainly white, though evidently neglected. I
am<br>
 sure I must have bruised him. I do not think spirits -'</p>

<p>'Get him a glass of sherry, then, and let him squat on the
cot.<br>
 Now, Kim,' continued Father Victor, 'no one is going to hurt
you.<br>
 Drink that down and tell us about yourself. The truth, if you've
no<br>
 objection.'</p>

<p>Kim coughed a little as he put down the empty glass, and<br>
 considered. This seemed a time for caution and fancy. Small
boys<br>
 who prowl about camps are generally turned out after a
whipping.<br>
 But he had received no stripes; the amulet was evidently working
in<br>
 his favour, and it looked as though the Umballa horoscope and
the<br>
 few words that he could remember of his father's maunderings
fitted<br>
 in most miraculously. Else why did the fat padre seem so
impressed,<br>
 and why the glass of hot yellow drink from the lean one?</p>

<p>'My father, he is dead in Lahore city since I was very little.
The<br>
 woman, she kept kabarri shop near where the hire-carriages
are.'<br>
 Kim began with a plunge, not quite sure how far the truth
would<br>
 serve him.</p>

<p>'Your mother?'</p>

<p>'No!' - with a gesture of disgust. 'She went out when I was
born.<br>
 My father, he got these papers from the Jadoo-Gher what do you
call<br>
 that?' (Bennett nodded) 'because he was in good-standing. What
do<br>
 you call that?' (again Bennett nodded). 'My father told me that.
He<br>
 said, too, and also the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust
at<br>
 Umballa two days ago, he said, that I shall find a Red Bull on
a<br>
 green field and that the Bull shall help me.'</p>

<p>'A phenomenal little liar,' muttered Bennett.</p>

<p>'Powers of Darkness below, what a country!' murmured Father
Victor.<br>
 'Go on, Kim.'</p>

<p>'I did not thieve. Besides, I am just now disciple of a very
holy<br>
 man. He is sitting outside. We saw two men come with flags,
making<br>
 the place ready. That is always so in a dream, or on account of
a -<br>
 a -prophecy. So I knew it was come true. I saw the Red Bull on
the<br>
 green field, and my father he said: "Nine hundred pukka devils
and<br>
 the Colonel riding on a horse will look after you when you find
the<br>
 Red Bull!" I did not know what to do when I saw the Bull, but
I<br>
 went away and I came again when it was dark. I wanted to see
the<br>
 Bull again, and I saw the Bull again with the - the Sahibs
praying<br>
 to it. I think the Bull shall help me. The holy man said so too.
He<br>
 is sitting outside. Will you hurt him, if I call him a shout
now?<br>
 He is very holy. He can witness to all the things I say, and
he<br>
 knows I am not a thief.'</p>

<p>'"Sahibs praying to a bull!" What in the world do you make
of<br>
 that?' said Bennett. "'Disciple of a holy man!" Is the boy
mad?'</p>

<p>'It's O'Hara's boy, sure enough. O'Hara's boy leagued with all
the<br>
 Powers of Darkness. It's very much what his father would have
done<br>
 if he was drunk. We'd better invite the holy man. He may
know<br>
 something.'</p>

<p>'He does not know anything,' said Kim. 'I will show you him if
you<br>
 come. He is my master. Then afterwards we can go.'</p>

<p><br>
 'Powers of Darkness!' was all that Father Victor could say,
as<br>
 Bennett marched off, with a firm hand on Kim's shoulder.</p>

<p>They found the lama where he had dropped.</p>

<p>'The Search is at an end for me,' shouted Kim in the
vernacular. 'I<br>
 have found the Bull, but God knows what comes next. They will
not<br>
 hurt you. Come to the fat priest's tent with this thin man and
see<br>
 the end. It is all new, and they cannot talk Hindi. They are
only<br>
 uncurried donkeys.'</p>

<p>'Then it is not well to make a jest of their ignorance,' the
lama<br>
 returned. 'I am glad if thou art rejoiced, chela.'</p>

<p>Dignified and unsuspicious, he strode into the little tent,
saluted<br>
 the Churches as a Churchman, and sat down by the open
charcoal<br>
 brazier. The yellow lining of the tent reflected in the
lamplight<br>
 made his face red-gold.</p>

<p>Bennett looked at him with the triple-ringed uninterest of
the<br>
 creed that lumps nine-tenths of the world under the title of<br>
 'heathen'.</p>

<p>'And what was the end of the Search? What gift has the Red
Bull<br>
 brought?' The lama addressed himself to Kim.</p>

<p>'He says, "What are you going to do?"' Bennett was staring
uneasily<br>
 at Father Victor, and Kim, for his own ends, took upon himself
the<br>
 office of interpreter.</p>

<p>'I do not see what concern this fakir has with the boy, who
is<br>
 probably his dupe or his confederate,' Bennett began. 'We
cannot<br>
 allow an English boy - Assuming that he is the son of a Mason,
the<br>
 sooner he goes to the Masonic Orphanage the better.'</p>

<p>'Ah! That's your opinion as Secretary to the Regimental
Lodge,'<br>
 said Father Victor; 'but we might as well tell the old man what
we<br>
 are going to do. He doesn't look like a villain.'</p>

<p>'My experience is that one can never fathom the Oriental mind.
Now,<br>
 Kimball, I wish you to tell this man what I say word for
word.'</p>

<p>Kim gathered the import of the next few sentences and began
thus:</p>

<p>'Holy One, the thin fool who looks like a camel says that I am
the<br>
 son of a Sahib.'</p>

<p>'But how?'</p>

<p>'Oh, it is true. I knew it since my birth, but he could only
find<br>
 it out by rending the amulet from my neck and reading all
the<br>
 papers. He thinks that once a Sahib is always a Sahib, and
between<br>
 the two of them they purpose to keep me in this Regiment or to
send<br>
 me to a madrissah [a school]. It has happened before. I have
always<br>
 avoided it. The fat fool is of one mind and the camel-like one
of<br>
 another. But that is no odds. I may spend one night here and<br>
 perhaps the next. It has happened before. Then I will run away
and<br>
 return to thee.'</p>

<p>'But tell them that thou art my chela. Tell them how thou
didst<br>
 come to me when I was faint and bewildered. Tell them of our<br>
 Search, and they will surely let thee go now.'</p>

<p>'I have already told them. They laugh, and they talk of
the<br>
 police.'</p>

<p>'What are you saying?' asked Mr Bennett.</p>

<p>'Oah. He only says that if you do not let me go it will stop
him in<br>
 his business - his ur-gent private af-fairs.' This last was
a<br>
 reminiscence of some talk with a Eurasian clerk in the Canal<br>
 Department, but it only drew a smile, which nettled him. 'And
if<br>
 you did know what his business was you would not be in such
a<br>
 beastly hurry to interfere.'</p>

<p>'What is it then?' said Father Victor, not without feeling, as
he<br>
 watched the lama's face.</p>

<p>'There is a River in this country which he wishes to find so
verree<br>
 much. It was put out by an Arrow which -'Kim tapped his foot<br>
 impatiently as he translated in his own mind from the vernacular
to<br>
 his clumsy English. 'Oah, it was made by our Lord God Buddha,
you<br>
 know, and if you wash there you are washed away from all your
sins<br>
 and made as white as cotton-wool.' (Kim had heard mission-talk
in<br>
 his time.) 'I am his disciple, and we must find that River. It
is<br>
 so verree valuable to us.'</p>

<p>'Say that again,' said Bennett. Kim obeyed, with
amplifications.</p>

<p>'But this is gross blasphemy!' cried the Church of
England.</p>

<p>'Tck! Tck!' said Father Victor sympathetically. 'I'd give a
good<br>
 deal to be able to talk the vernacular. A river that washes
away<br>
 sin! And how long have you two been looking for it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, many days. Now we wish to go away and look for it again.
It is<br>
 not here, you see.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Father Victor gravely. 'But he can't go on in
that<br>
 old man's company. It would be different, Kim, if you were not
a<br>
 soldier's son. Tell him that the Regiment will take care of you
and<br>
 make you as good a man as your - as good a man as can be. Tell
him<br>
 that if he believes in miracles he must believe that -'</p>

<p>'There is no need to play on his credulity,' Bennett
interrupted.</p>

<p>'I'm doing no such thing. He must believe that the boy's
coming<br>
 here -to his own Regiment - in search of his Red Bull is in
the<br>
 nature of a miracle. Consider the chances against it, Bennett.
This<br>
 one boy in all India, and our Regiment of all others on the line
o'<br>
 march for him to meet with! It's predestined on the face of
it.<br>
 Yes, tell him it's Kismet. Kismet, mallum? [Do you
understand?]'</p>

<p>He turned towards the lama, to whom he might as well have
talked of<br>
 Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>'They say,' - the old man's eye lighted at Kim's speech 'they
say<br>
 that the meaning of my horoscope is now accomplished, and
that<br>
 being led back - though as thou knowest I went out of curiosity
-<br>
 to these people and their Red Bull I must needs go to a
madrissah<br>
 and be turned into a Sahib. Now I make pretence of agreement,
for<br>
 at the worst it will be but a few meals eaten away from thee.
Then<br>
 I will slip away and follow down the road to Saharunpore.<br>
 Therefore, Holy One, keep with that Kulu woman - on no
account<br>
 stray far from her cart till I come again. Past question, my
sign<br>
 is of War and of armed men. See how they have given me wine
to<br>
 drink and set me upon a bed of honour! My father must have
been<br>
 some great person. So if they raise me to honour among them,
good.<br>
 If not, good again. However it goes, I will run back to thee
when I<br>
 am tired. But stay with the Rajputni, or I shall miss thy feet
...<br>
 Oah yess,' said the boy, 'I have told him everything you tell me
to<br>
 say.'</p>

<p>'And I cannot see any need why he should wait,' said
Bennett,<br>
 feeling in his trouser-pocket. 'We can investigate the
details<br>
 later - and I will give him a ru -'</p>

<p>'Give him time. Maybe he's fond of the lad,' said Father
Victor,<br>
 half arresting the clergyman's motion.</p>

<p>The lama dragged forth his rosary and pulled his huge hat-brim
over<br>
 his eyes.</p>

<p>'What can he want now?'</p>

<p>'He says' - Kim put up one hand. 'He says: Be quiett.' He
wants to<br>
 speak to me by himself You see, you do not know one little word
of<br>
 what he says, and I think if you talk he will perhaps give you
very<br>
 bad curses. When he takes those beads like that, you see, he
always<br>
 wants to be quiett.'</p>

<p>The two Englishmen sat overwhelmed, but there was a look
in<br>
 Bennett's eye that promised ill for Kim when he should be
relaxed<br>
 to the religious arm.</p>

<p>'A Sahib and the son of a Sahib -' The lama's voice was harsh
with<br>
 pain. 'But no white man knows the land and the customs of the
land<br>
 as thou knowest. How comes it this is true?'</p>

<p>'What matter, Holy One? - but remember it is only for a night
or<br>
 two. Remember, I can change swiftly. It will all be as it was
when<br>
 I first spoke to thee under Zam-Zammah the great gun -'</p>

<p>'As a boy in the dress of white men - when I first went to
the<br>
 Wonder House. And a second time thou wast a Hindu. What shall
the<br>
 third incarnation be?' He chuckled drearily. 'Ah, chela, thou
has<br>
 done a wrong to an old man because my heart went out to
thee.'</p>

<p>'And mine to thee. But how could I know that the Red Bull
would<br>
 bring me to this business?'</p>

<p>The lama covered his face afresh, and nervously rattled the
rosary.<br>
 Kim squatted beside him and laid hold upon a fold of his
clothing.</p>

<p>'Now it is understood that the boy is a Sahib?' he went on in
a<br>
 muffled tone. 'Such a Sahib as was he who kept the images in
the<br>
 Wonder House.' The lama's experience of white men was limited.
He<br>
 seemed to be repeating a lesson. 'So then it is not seemly that
he<br>
 should do other than as the Sahibs do. He must go back to his
own<br>
 people.'</p>

<p>'For a day and a night and a day,' Kim pleaded.</p>

<p>'No, ye don't!' Father Victor saw Kim edging towards the door,
and<br>
 interposed a strong leg.</p>

<p>'I do not understand the customs of white men. The Priest of
the<br>
 Images in the Wonder House in Lahore was more courteous than
the<br>
 thin one here. This boy will be taken from me. They will make
a<br>
 Sahib of my disciple? Woe to me! How shall I find my River?
Have<br>
 they no disciples? Ask.'</p>

<p>'He says he is very sorree that he cannot find the River now
any<br>
 more. He says, Why have you no disciples, and stop bothering
him?<br>
 He wants to be washed of his sins.'</p>

<p>Neither Bennett nor Father Victor found any answer ready.</p>

<p>Said Kim in English, distressed for the lama's agony: 'I think
if<br>
 you will let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal.
We<br>
 will look for that River like before I was caught. I wish I did
not<br>
 come here to find the Red Bull and all that sort of thing. I do
not<br>
 want it.'</p>

<p>'It's the very best day's work you ever did for yourself,
young<br>
 man,' said Bennett.</p>

<p>'Good heavens, I don't know how to console him,' said
Father<br>
 Victor, watching the lama intently. 'He can't take the boy
away<br>
 with him, and yet he's a good man - I'm sure he's a good
man.<br>
 Bennett, if you give him that rupee he'll curse you root and<br>
 branch!'</p>

<p>They listened to each other's breathing - three - five
full<br>
 minutes. Then the lama raised his head, and looked forth
across<br>
 them into space and emptiness.</p>

<p>'And I am a Follower of the Way,' he said bitterly. 'The sin
is<br>
 mine and the punishment is mine. I made believe to myself for
now I<br>
 see it was but make-belief - that thou wast sent to me to aid
in<br>
 the Search. So my heart went out to thee for thy charity and
thy<br>
 courtesy and the wisdom of thy little years. But those who
follow<br>
 the Way must permit not the fire of any desire or attachment,
for<br>
 that is all Illusion. As says . . .' He quoted an old, old
Chinese<br>
 text, backed it with another, and reinforced these with a third.
'I<br>
 stepped aside from the Way, my chela. It was no fault of thine.
I<br>
 delighted in the sight of life, the new people upon the roads,
and<br>
 in thy joy at seeing these things. I was pleased with thee
who<br>
 should have considered my Search and my Search alone. Now I
am<br>
 sorrowful because thou art taken away and my River is far from
me.<br>
 It is the Law which I have broken!'</p>

<p>'Powers of Darkness below!' said Father Victor, who, wise in
the<br>
 confessional, heard the pain in every sentence.</p>

<p>'I see now that the sign of the Red Bull was a sign for me as
well<br>
 as for thee. All Desire is red - and evil. I will do penance
and<br>
 find my River alone.'</p>

<p>'At least go back to the Kulu woman,' said Kim, 'otherwise
thou<br>
 wilt be lost upon the roads. She will feed thee till I run back
to<br>
 thee.'</p>

<p>The lama waved a hand to show that the matter was finally
settled<br>
 in his mind.</p>

<p>'Now,' - his tone altered as he turned to Kim, - 'what will
they do<br>
 with thee? At least I may, acquiring merit, wipe out past
ill.'</p>

<p>'Make me a Sahib - so they think. The day after tomorrow I
return.<br>
 Do not grieve.'</p>

<p>'Of what sort? Such an one as this or that man?' He pointed
to<br>
 Father Victor. 'Such an one as those I saw this evening men
wearing<br>
 swords and stamping heavily?'</p>

<p>'Maybe.'</p>

<p>'That is not well. These men follow desire and come to
emptiness.<br>
 Thou must not be of their sort.'</p>

<p>'The Umballa priest said that my Star was War,' Kim
interjected. 'I<br>
 will ask these fools - but there is truly no need. I will run
away<br>
 this night, for all I wanted to see the new things.'</p>

<p>Kim put two or three questions in English to Father
Victor,<br>
 translating the replies to the lama.</p>

<p>Then: 'He says, "You take him from me and you cannot say what
you<br>
 will make him." He says, "Tell me before I go, for it is not
a<br>
 small thing to make a child."'</p>

<p>'You will be sent to a school. Later on, we shall see.
Kimball, I<br>
 suppose you'd like to be a soldier?'</p>

<p>'Gorah-log [white-folk]. No-ah! No-ah!' Kim shook his head<br>
 violently. There was nothing in his composition to which drill
and<br>
 routine appealed. 'I will not be a soldier.'</p>

<p>'You will be what you're told to be,' said Bennett; 'and you
should<br>
 be grateful that we're going to help you.'</p>

<p><br>
 Kim smiled compassionately. If these men lay under the
delusion<br>
 that he would do anything that he did not fancy, so much the<br>
 better.</p>

<p>Another long silence followed. Bennett fidgeted with
impatience,<br>
 and suggested calling a sentry to evict the fakir.</p>

<p>'Do they give or sell learning among the Sahibs? Ask them,'
said<br>
 the lama, and Kim interpreted.</p>

<p>'They say that money is paid to the teacher - but that money
the<br>
 Regiment will give ... What need? It is only for a night.'</p>

<p>'And - the more money is paid the better learning is given?'
The<br>
 lama disregarded Kim's plans for an early flight. 'It is no
wrong<br>
 to pay for learning. To help the ignorant to wisdom is always
a<br>
 merit.' The rosary clicked furiously as an abacus. Then he
faced<br>
 his oppressors.</p>

<p>'Ask them for how much money do they give a wise and
suitable<br>
 teaching? And in what city is that teaching given?'</p>

<p>'Well,'said Father Victor in English, when Kim had
translated,<br>
 'that depends. The Regiment would pay for you all the time you
are<br>
 at the Military Orphanage; or you might go on the Punjab
Masonic<br>
 Orphanage's list (not that he or you 'ud understand what
that<br>
 means); but the best schooling a boy can get in India is, of<br>
 course, at St Xavier's in Partibus at Lucknow.' This took some
time<br>
 to interpret, for Bennett wished to cut it short.</p>

<p>'He wants to know how much?' said Kim placidly.</p>

<p>'Two or three hundred rupees a year.' Father Victor was long
past<br>
 any sense of amazement. Bennett, impatient, did not
understand.</p>

<p>'He says: "Write that name and the money upon a paper and give
it<br>
 him." And he says you must write your name below, because he
is<br>
 going to write a letter in some days to you. He says you are a
good<br>
 man. He says the other man is a tool. He is going away.'</p>

<p>The lama rose suddenly. 'I follow my Search,' he cried, and
was<br>
 gone.</p>

<p>'He'll run slap into the sentries,' cried Father Victor,
jumping up<br>
 as the lama stalked out; 'but I can't leave the boy.' Kim
made<br>
 swift motion to follow, but checked himself. There was no sound
of<br>
 challenge outside. The lama had disappeared.</p>

<p>Kim settled himself composedly on the Chaplain's cot. At least
the<br>
 lama had promised that he would stay with the Raiput woman
from<br>
 Kulu, and the rest was of the smallest importance. It pleased
him<br>
 that the two padres were so evidently excited. They talked long
in<br>
 undertones, Father Victor urging some scheme on Mr Bennett,
who<br>
 seemed incredulous. All this was very new and fascinating, but
Kim<br>
 felt sleepy. They called men into the tent - one of them
certainly<br>
 was the Colonel, as his father had prophesied - and they asked
him<br>
 an infinity of questions, chiefly about the woman who looked
after<br>
 him, all of which Kim answered truthfully. They did not seem
to<br>
 think the woman a good guardian.</p>

<p><br>
 After all, this was the newest of his experiences. Sooner or
later,<br>
 if he chose, he could escape into great, grey, formless
India,<br>
 beyond tents and padres and colonels. Meantime, if the Sahibs
were<br>
 to be impressed, he would do his best to impress them. He too
was a<br>
 white man.</p>

<p>After much talk that he could not comprehend, they handed him
over<br>
 to a sergeant, who had strict instructions not to let him
escape.<br>
 The Regiment would go on to Umballa, and Kim would be sent
up,<br>
 partly at the expense of the Lodge and in part by subscription,
to<br>
 a place called Sanawar.</p>

<p>'It's miraculous past all whooping, Colonel,' said Father
Victor,<br>
 when he had talked without a break for ten minutes. 'His
Buddhist<br>
 friend has levanted after taking my name and address. I can't
quite<br>
 make out whether he'll pay for the boy's education or whether he
is<br>
 preparing some sort of witchcraft on his own account.' Then to
Kim:<br>
 'You'll live to be grateful to your friend the Red Bull yet.
We'll<br>
 make a man of you at Sanawar - even at the price o' making you
a<br>
 Protestant.'</p>

<p>'Certainly - most certainly,' said Bennett.</p>

<p>'But you will not go to Sanawar,' said Kim.</p>

<p>'But we will go to Sanawar, little man. That's the order of
the<br>
 Commander-in-Chief, who's a trifle more important than
O'Hara's<br>
 son.'</p>

<p>'You will not go to Sanawar. You will go to thee War.'</p>

<p>There was a shout of laughter from the full tent.</p>

<p>'When you know your own Regiment a trifle better you won't
confuse<br>
 the line of march with line of battle, Kim. We hope to go to
"thee<br>
 War" sometime.'</p>

<p>'Oah, I know all thatt.' Kim drew his bow again at a venture.
If<br>
 they were not going to the war, at least they did not know what
he<br>
 knew of the talk in the veranda at Umballa.</p>

<p>'I know you are not at thee war now; but I tell you that as
soon as<br>
 you get to Umballa you will be sent to the war - the new war. It
is<br>
 a war of eight thousand men, besides the guns.'</p>

<p>'That's explicit. D'you add prophecy to your other gifts? Take
him<br>
 along, sergeant. Take up a suit for him from the Drums, an'
take<br>
 care he doesn't slip through your fingers. Who says the age
of<br>
 miracles is gone by? I think I'll go to bed. My poor mind's<br>
 weakening.'</p>

<p>At the far end of the camp, silent as a wild animal, an hour
later<br>
 sat Kim, newly washed all over, in a horrible stuff suit
that<br>
 rasped his arms and legs.</p>

<p>'A most amazin' young bird,' said the sergeant. 'He turns up
in<br>
 charge of a yellow-headed buck-Brahmin priest, with his
father's<br>
 Lodge certificates round his neck, talkin' God knows what all of
a<br>
 red bull. The buck-Brahmin evaporates without explanations, an'
the<br>
 bhoy sets cross-legged on the Chaplain's bed prophesyin' bloody
war<br>
 to the men at large. Injia's a wild land for a God-fearin'
man.<br>
 I'll just tie his leg to the tent-pole in case he'll go through
the<br>
 roof What did ye say about the war?'</p>

<p>'Eight thousand men, besides guns,' said Kim. 'Very soon you
will<br>
 see.'</p>

<p>'You're a consolin' little imp. Lie down between the Drums an'
go<br>
 to bye-bye. Those two boys will watch your slumbers.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><br>
 Now I remember comrades -<br>
 Old playmates on new seas -<br>
 Whenas we traded orpiment<br>
 Among the savages.<br>
 Ten thousand leagues to southward,<br>
 And thirty years removed -<br>
 They knew not noble Valdez,<br>
 But me they knew and loved.</p>

<p>Song of Diego Valdez.</p>

<p><br>
 Very early in the morning the white tents came down and
disappeared<br>
 as the Mavericks took a side-road to Umballa. It did not skirt
the<br>
 resting-place, and Kim, trudging beside a baggage-cart under
fire<br>
 of comments from soldiers' wives, was not so confident as<br>
 overnight. He discovered that he was closely watched -
Father<br>
 Victor on the one side, and Mr Bennett on the other.</p>

<p><br>
 In the forenoon the column checked. A camel-orderly handed
the<br>
 Colonel a letter. He read it, and spoke to a Major. Half a mile
in<br>
 the rear, Kim heard a hoarse and joyful clamour rolling down on
him<br>
 through the thick dust. Then someone beat him on the back,
crying:<br>
 'Tell us how ye knew, ye little limb of Satan? Father dear, see
if<br>
 ye can make him tell.'</p>

<p>A pony ranged alongside, and he was hauled on to the
priest's<br>
 saddlebow.</p>

<p>'Now, my son, your prophecy of last night has come true. Our
orders<br>
 are to entrain at Umballa for the Front tomorrow.'</p>

<p>'What is thatt?' said Kim, for 'front' and 'entrain' were
newish<br>
 words to him.</p>

<p>'We are going to "thee War," as you called it.'</p>

<p>'Of course you are going to thee War. I said last night.'</p>

<p>'Ye did; but, Powers o' Darkness, how did ye know?'</p>

<p>Kim's eyes sparkled. He shut his lips, nodded his head, and
looked<br>
 unspeakable things. The Chaplain moved on through the dust,
and<br>
 privates, sergeants, and subalterns called one another's
attention<br>
 to the boy. The Colonel, at the head of the column, stared at
him<br>
 curiously. 'It was probably some bazar rumour.' he said; 'but
even<br>
 then -' He referred to the paper in his hand. 'Hang it all,
the<br>
 thing was only decided within the last forty-eight hours.'</p>

<p>Are there many more like you in India?' said Father Victor,
'or are<br>
 you by way o' being a lusus naturae?'</p>

<p>'Now I have told you,' said the boy, 'will you let me go back
to my<br>
 old man? If he has not stayed with that woman from Kulu, I
am<br>
 afraid he will die.'</p>

<p>'By what I saw of him he's as well able to take care of
himself as<br>
 you. No. Ye've brought us luck, an' we're goin' to make a man
of<br>
 you. I'll take ye back to your baggage-cart and ye'll come to
me<br>
 this evening.'</p>

<p>For the rest of the day Kim found himself an object of<br>
 distinguished consideration among a few hundred white men.
The<br>
 story of his appearance in camp, the discovery of his
parentage,<br>
 and his prophecy, had lost nothing in the telling. A big,
shapeless<br>
 white woman on a pile of bedding asked him mysteriously whether
he<br>
 thought her husband would come back from the war. Kim
reflected<br>
 gravely, and said that he would, and the woman gave him food.
In<br>
 many respects, this big procession that played music at
intervals -<br>
 this crowd that talked and laughed so easily - resembled a
festival<br>
 in Lahore city. So far, there was no sign of hard work, and
he<br>
 resolved to lend the spectacle his patronage. At evening there
came<br>
 out to meet them bands of music, and played the Mavericks into
camp<br>
 near Umballa railway station. That was an interesting night. Men
of<br>
 other regiments came to visit the Mavericks. The Mavericks
went<br>
 visiting on their own account. Their pickets hurried forth to
bring<br>
 them back, met pickets of strange regiments on the same duty;
and,<br>
 after a while, the bugles blew madly for more pickets with
officers<br>
 to control the tumult. The Mavericks had a reputation for<br>
 liveliness to live up to. But they fell in on the platform
next<br>
 morning in perfect shape and condition; and Kim, left behind
with<br>
 the sick, women, and boys, found himself shouting farewells<br>
 excitedly as the trains drew away. Life as a Sahib was amusing
so<br>
 far; but he touched it with a cautious hand. Then they marched
him<br>
 back in charge of a drummer-boy to empty, lime-washed
barracks,<br>
 whose floors were covered with rubbish and string and paper,
and<br>
 whose ceilings gave back his lonely footfall. Native-fashion,
he<br>
 curled himself up on a stripped cot and went to sleep. An angry
man<br>
 stumped down the veranda, woke him up, and said he was a<br>
 schoolmaster. This was enough for Kim, and he retired into
his<br>
 shell. He could just puzzle out the various English Police
notices<br>
 in Lahore city, because they affected his comfort; and among
the<br>
 many guests of the woman who looked after him had been a
queer<br>
 German who painted scenery for the Parsee travelling theatre.
He<br>
 told Kim that he had been 'on the barricades in 'Forty-eight,'
and<br>
 therefore - at least that was how it struck Kim - he would
teach<br>
 the boy to write in return for food. Kim had been kicked as far
as<br>
 single letters, but did not think well of them.</p>

<p>'I do not know anything. Go away!' said Kim, scenting
evil.<br>
 Hereupon the man caught him by the ear, dragged him to a room in
a<br>
 far-off wing where a dozen drummer-boys were sitting on forms,
and<br>
 told him to be still if he could do nothing else. This he
managed<br>
 very successfully. The man explained something or other with
white<br>
 lines or a black board for at least half an hour, and Kim
continued<br>
 his interrupted nap. He much disapproved of the present aspect
of<br>
 affairs, for this was the very school and discipline he had
spent<br>
 two-thirds of his young life in avoiding. Suddenly a beautiful
idea<br>
 occurred to him, and he wondered that he had not thought of
it<br>
 before.</p>

<p>The man dismissed them, and first to spring through the
veranda<br>
 into the open sunshine was Kim.</p>

<p>' 'Ere, you! 'Alt! Stop!' said a high voice at his heels.
'I've got<br>
 to look after you. My orders are not to let you out of my
sight.<br>
 Where are you goin'?'</p>

<p>It was the drummer-boy who had been hanging round him all
the<br>
 forenoon - a fat and freckled person of about fourteen, and
Kim<br>
 loathed him from the soles of his boots to his cap-ribbons.</p>

<p>'To the bazar - to get sweets - for you,' said Kim, after
thought.</p>

<p>'Well, the bazar's out o' bounds. If we go there we'll get
a<br>
 dressing-down. You come back.'</p>

<p>'How near can we go?' Kim did not know what bounds meant, but
he<br>
 wished to be polite - for the present.</p>

<p>' 'Ow near? 'Ow far, you mean! We can go as far as that tree
down<br>
 the road.'</p>

<p>'Then I will go there.'</p>

<p>'All right. I ain't goin'. It's too 'ot. I can watch you from
'ere.<br>
 It's no good your runnin' away. If you did, they'd spot you by
your<br>
 clothes. That's regimental stuff you're wearin'. There ain't
a<br>
 picket in Umballa wouldn't 'ead you back quicker than you
started<br>
 out.'</p>

<p>This did not impress Kim as much as the knowledge that his
raiment<br>
 would tire him out if he tried to run. He slouched to the tree
at<br>
 the corner of a bare road leading towards the bazar, and eyed
the<br>
 natives passing. Most of them were barrack-servants of the
lowest<br>
 caste. Kim hailed a sweeper, who promptly retorted with a piece
of<br>
 unnecessary insolence, in the natural belief that the European
boy<br>
 could not follow it. The low, quick answer undeceived him. Kim
put<br>
 his fettered soul into it, thankful for the late chance to
abuse<br>
 somebody in the tongue he knew best. 'And now, go to the
nearest<br>
 letter-writer in the bazar and tell him to come here. I would
write<br>
 a letter.'</p>

<p>'But - but what manner of white man's son art thou to need a
bazar<br>
 letter-writer? Is there not a schoolmaster in the barracks?'</p>

<p>'Ay; and Hell is full of the same sort. Do my order, you - you
Od!<br>
 Thy mother was married under a basket! Servant of Lal Beg'
(Kim<br>
 knew the God of the sweepers), 'run on my business or we will
talk<br>
 again.'</p>

<p>The sweeper shuffled off in haste. 'There is a white boy by
the<br>
 barracks waiting under a tree who is not a white boy,' he
stammered<br>
 to the first bazar letter-writer he came across. 'He needs
thee.'<br>
 TO HERE</p>

<p>'Will he pay?' said the spruce scribe, gathering up his
desk<br>
 and pens and sealing-wax all in order.</p>

<p>'I do not know. He is not like other boys. Go and see. It
is<br>
 well worth.'</p>

<p>Kim danced with impatience when the slim young Kayeth hove
in<br>
 sight. As soon as his voice could carry he cursed him
volubly.</p>

<p>'First I will take my pay,' the letter-writer said. 'Bad words
have<br>
 made the price higher. But who art thou, dressed in that
fashion,<br>
 to speak in this fashion?'</p>

<p>'Aha! That is in the letter which thou shalt write. Never was
such<br>
 a tale. But I am in no haste. Another writer will serve me.
Umballa<br>
 city is as full of them as is Lahore.'</p>

<p>'Four annas,' said the writer, sitting down and spreading his
cloth<br>
 in the shade of a deserted barrack-wing.</p>

<p>Mechanically Kim squatted beside him squatted as only the
natives<br>
 can - in spite of the abominable clinging trousers.</p>

<p>The writer regarded him sideways.</p>

<p>'That is the price to ask of Sahibs,' said Kim. 'Now fix me a
true<br>
 one.'</p>

<p>'An anna and a half. How do I know, having written the letter,
that<br>
 thou wilt not run away?'</p>

<p>I must not go beyond this tree, and there is also the stamp to
be<br>
 considered.'</p>

<p>'I get no commission on the price of the stamp. Once more,
what<br>
 manner of white boy art thou?'</p>

<p>'That shall be said in the letter, which is to Mahbub Ali,
the<br>
 horse-dealer in the Kashmir Serai, at Lahore. He is my
friend.'</p>

<p>'Wonder on wonder!' murmured the letter-writer, dipping a reed
in<br>
 the inkstand. 'To be written in Hindi?'</p>

<p>'Assuredly. To Mahbub Ali then. Begin! I have come down with
the<br>
 old man as far as Umballa in the train. At Umballa I carried
the<br>
 news of the bay mare's pedigree.' After what he had seen in
the<br>
 garden, he was not going to write of white stallions.</p>

<p>'Slower a little. What has a bay mare to do . . . Is it Mahbub
Ali,<br>
 the great dealer?'</p>

<p>'Who else? I have been in his service. Take more ink. Again.
As the<br>
 order was, so I did it. We then went on foot towards Benares,
but<br>
 on the third day we found a certain regiment. Is that down?'</p>

<p>'Ay, pulton,''' murmured the writer, all ears.</p>

<p>'I went into their camp and was caught, and by means of the
charm<br>
 about my neck, which thou kno west, it was established that I
was<br>
 the son of some man in the regiment: according to the prophecy
of<br>
 the Red Bull, which thou knowest was common talk of our bazar.'
Kim<br>
 waited for this shaft to sink into the letter-writer's
heart,<br>
 cleared his throat, and continued: 'A priest clothed me and gave
me<br>
 a new name . . . One priest, however, was a fool. The clothes
are<br>
 very heavy, but I am a Sahib and my heart is heavy too. They
send<br>
 me to a school and beat me. I do not like the air and water
here.<br>
 Come then and help me, Mahbub Ali, or send me some money, for
I<br>
 have not sufficient to pay the writer who writes this.</p>

<p>' "Who writes this." It is my own fault that I was tricked.
Thou<br>
 art as clever as Husain Bux that forged the Treasury stamps
at<br>
 Nucklao. But what a tale! What a tale! Is it true by any
chance?'</p>

<p>'It does not profit to tell lies to Mahbub Ali. It is better
to<br>
 help his friends by lending them a stamp. When the money comes
I<br>
 will repay.'</p>

<p>The writer grunted doubtfully, but took a stamp out of his
desk,<br>
 sealed the letter, handed it over to Kim, and departed.
Mahbub<br>
 Ali's was a name of power in Umballa.</p>

<p>'That is the way to win a good account with the Gods,' Kim
shouted<br>
 after him.</p>

<p>'Pay me twice over when the money comes,' the man cried over
his<br>
 shoulder.</p>

<p>'What was you bukkin' to that nigger about?' said the
drummer-boy<br>
 when Kim returned to the veranda. 'I was watch-in' you.'</p>

<p>'I was only talkin' to him.'</p>

<p>'You talk the same as a nigger, don't you?'</p>

<p>'No-ah! No-ah! I onlee speak a little. What shall we do
now?'</p>

<p>'The bugles'll go for dinner in arf a minute. My Gawd! I wish
I'd<br>
 gone up to the Front with the Regiment. It's awful doin'
nothin'<br>
 but school down 'ere. Don't you 'ate it?'</p>

<p>'Oah yess!'</p>

<p>I'd run away if I knew where to go to, but, as the men say, in
this<br>
 bloomin' Injia you're only a prisoner at large. You can't
desert<br>
 without bein' took back at once. I'm fair sick of it.'</p>

<br>
'You have been in Be - England?'

<p>'W'y, I only come out last troopin' season with my mother. I
should<br>
 think I 'ave been in England. What a ignorant little beggar
you<br>
 are! You was brought up in the gutter, wasn't you?'</p>

<p>'Oah yess. Tell me something about England. My father he came
from<br>
 there.'</p>

<p>Though he would not say so, Kim of course disbelieved every
word<br>
 the drummer-boy spoke about the Liverpool suburb which was
his<br>
 England. It passed the heavy time till dinner - a most
unappetizing<br>
 meal served to the boys and a few invalids in a corner of a<br>
 barrack-room. But that he had written to Mahbub Ali, Kim would
have<br>
 been almost depressed. The indifference of native crowds he
was<br>
 used to; but this strong loneliness among white men preyed on
him.<br>
 He was grateful when, in the course of the afternoon, a big
soldier<br>
 took him over to Father Victor, who lived in another wing
across<br>
 another dusty parade-ground. The priest was reading an
English<br>
 letter written in purple ink. He looked at Kim more curiously
than<br>
 ever.</p>

<p>'An' how do you like it, my son, as far as you've gone? Not
much,<br>
 eh? It must be hard - very hard on a wild animal. Listen now.
I've<br>
 an amazin' epistle from your friend.'</p>

<p>'Where is he? Is he well? Oah! If he knows to write me
letters, it<br>
 is all right.'</p>

<p>'You're fond of him then?'</p>

<p>'Of course I am fond of him. He was fond of me.'</p>

<p>'It seems so by the look of this. He can't write English, can
he?'</p>

<p>'Oah no. Not that I know, but of course he found a
letter-writer<br>
 who can write English verree well, and so he wrote. I do hope
you<br>
 understand.'</p>

<p>'That accounts for it. D'you know anything about his money<br>
 affairs?' Kim's face showed that he did not.</p>

<p>'How can I tell?'</p>

<p>'That's what I'm askin'. Now listen if you can make head or
tail o'<br>
 this. We'll skip the first part . . . It's written from
Jagadhir<br>
 Road . . . "Sitting on wayside in grave meditation, trusting to
be<br>
 favoured with your Honour's applause of present step, which<br>
 recommend your Honour to execute for Almighty God's sake.
Education<br>
 is greatest blessing if of best sorts. Otherwise no earthly
use."<br>
 Faith, the old man's hit the bull's-eye that time! "If your
Honour<br>
 condescending giving my boy best educations Xavier" (I
suppose<br>
 that's St Xavier's in Partibus) "in terms of our conversation
dated<br>
 in your tent 15th instant" (a business-like touch there!)
"then<br>
 Almighty God blessing your Honour's succeedings to third an'
fourth<br>
 generation and" - now listen! -"confide in your Honour's
humble<br>
 servant for adequate remuneration per hoondi per annum three<br>

 Lucknow, and allow small time to forward same per hoondi sent

of<br>

any<br>
 domestic capacity." Now what in the world does that mean?'</p>

<p>'She has asked him to be her puro - her clergyman - at
Saharunpore,<br>
 I think. He would not do that on account of his River. She
did<br>
 talk.'</p>

<p>'It's clear to you, is it? It beats me altogether. "So going
to<br>
 Benares, where will find address and forward rupees for boy who
is<br>
 apple of eye, and for Almighty God's sake execute this
education,<br>
 and your petitioner as in duty bound shall ever awfully

note<br>
 boy is apple of eye, and rupees shall be sent per hoondi
three<br>
 hundred per annum. For God Almighty's sake." Now, is that
ravin'<br>
 lunacy or a business proposition? I ask you, because I'm fairly
at<br>
 my wits' end.'</p>

<p>'He says he will give me three hundred rupees a year? So he
will<br>
 give me them.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that's the way you look at it, is it?'</p>

<p>'Of course. If he says so!'</p>

<p>The priest whistled; then he addressed Kim as an equal.'I
don't<br>
 believe it; but we'll see. You were goin' off today to the<br>
 Military Orphanage at Sanawar, where the Regiment would keep
you<br>
 till you were old enough to enlist. Ye'd be brought up to
the<br>
 Church of England. Bennett arranged for that. On the other hand,
if<br>
 ye go to St Xavier's ye'll get a better education an - an can
have<br>
 the religion. D'ye see my dilemma? Kim saw nothing save a
vision<br>
 of the lama going south in a train with none to beg for him.</p>

<p>'Like most people, I'm going to temporize. If your friend
sends the<br>
 money from Benares - Powers of Darkness below, where's a
street-<br>
 beggar to raise three hundred rupees? - ye'll go down to
Lucknow<br>
 and I'll pay your fare, because I can't touch the
subscription-<br>
 money if I intend, as I do, to make ye a Catholic. If he
doesn't,<br>
 ye'll go to the Military Orphanage at the Regiment's expense.
I'll<br>
 allow him three days' grace, though I don't believe it at all.
Even<br>
 then, if he fails in his payments later on . . . but it's
beyond<br>
 me. We can only walk one step at a time in this world, praise
God!<br>
 An' they sent Bennett to the Front an' left me behind.
Bennett<br>
 can't expect everything.'</p>

<p>'Oah yess,' said Kim vaguely.</p>

<p>The priest leaned forward. 'I'd give a month's pay to find
what's<br>
 goin' on inside that little round head of yours.'</p>

<p>'There is nothing,' said Kim, and scratched it. He was
wondering<br>
 whether Mahbub Ali would send him as much as a whole rupee. Then
he<br>
 could pay the letter-writer and write letters to the lama at<br>
 Benares. Perhaps Mahbub Ali would visit him next time he came
south<br>
 with horses. Surely he must know that Kim's delivery of the
letter<br>
 to the officer at Umballa had caused the great war which the
men<br>
 and boys had discussed so loudly over the barrack
dinner-tables.<br>
 But if Mahbub Ali did not know this, it would be very unsafe
to<br>
 tell him so. Mahbub Ali was hard upon boys who knew, or
thought<br>
 they knew, too much.</p>

<p>'Well, till I get further news' - Father Victor's voice
interrupted<br>
 the reverie. 'Ye can run along now and play with the other
boys.<br>
 They'll teach ye something - but I don't think ye'll like
it.'</p>

<p>The day dragged to its weary end. When he wished to sleep he
was<br>
 instructed how to fold up his clothes and set out his boots;
the<br>
 other boys deriding. Bugles waked him in the dawn; the
schoolmaster<br>
 caught him after breakfast, thrust a page of meaningless
characters<br>
 under his nose, gave them senseless names and whacked him
without<br>
 reason. Kim meditated poisoning him with opium borrowed from
a<br>
 barrack-sweeper, but reflected that, as they all ate at one
table<br>
 in public (this was peculiarly revolting to Kim, who preferred
to<br>
 turn his back on the world at meals), the stroke might be drug
the<br>
 lama the village where the old soldier lived. But far-seeing<br>
 sentries at every exit headed back the little scarlet
figure.<br>
 Trousers and jacket crippled body and mind alike dangerous. Then
he<br>
 attempted running off to the village where the priest had tried
to,<br>
 so he abandoned the project and fell back, Oriental-fashion,
on<br>
 time and chance. Three days of torment passed in the big,
echoing<br>
 white rooms. He walked out of affernoons under escort of the<br>
 drummer-boy, and all he heard from his companions were the
few<br>
 useless words which seemed to make two-thirds of the white
man's<br>
 abuse. Kim knew and despised them all long ago. The boy
resented<br>
 his silence and lack of interest by beating him, as was only<br>
 natural. He did not care for any of the bazars which were in<br>
 bounds. He styled all natives 'niggers'; yet servants and
sweepers<br>
 called him abominable names to his face, and, misled by
their<br>
 deferential attitude, he never understood. This somewhat
consoled<br>
 Kim for the beatings.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day a judgement overtook that
drummer.<br>
 They had gone out together towards Umballa racecourse. He
returned<br>
 alone, weeping, with news that young O'Hara, to whom he had
been<br>
 doing nothing in particular, had hailed a scarlet-bearded nigger
on<br>
 horseback; that the nigger had then and there laid into him with
a<br>
 peculiarly adhesive quirt, picked up young O'Hara, and borne
him<br>
 off at full gallop. These tidings came to Father Victor, and
he<br>
 drew down his long upper lip. He was already sufficiently
startled<br>
 by a letter from the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares,<br>
 enclosing a native banker's note of hand for three hundred
rupees,<br>
 and an amazing prayer to 'Almighty God'. The lama would have
been<br>
 more annoyed than the priest had he known how the bazar
letter-<br>
 writer had translated his phrase 'to acquire merit</p>

<p>'Powers of Darkness below!' Father Victor fumbled with the
note.<br>
 'An' now he's off with another of his peep-o'-day friends. I
don't<br>
 know whether it will be a greater relief to me to get him back
or<br>
 to have him lost. He's beyond my comprehension. How the Divil
-<br>
 yes, he's the man I mean -can a street-beggar raise money to<br>
 educate white boys?'</p>

<p>Three miles off, on Umballa racecourse, Mahbub Ali, reining a
grey<br>
 Kabuli stallion with Kim in front of him, was saying:</p>

<p>'But, Little Friend of all the World, there is my honour
and<br>
 reputation to be considered. All the officer-Sahibs in all
the<br>
 regiments, and all Umballa, know Mahbub Ali. Men saw me pick
thee<br>
 up and chastise that boy. We are seen now from far across
this<br>
 plain. How can I take thee away, or account for thy disappearing
if<br>
 I set thee down and let thee run off into the crops? They would
put<br>
 me in jail. Be patient. Once a Sahib, always a Sahib. When thou
art<br>
 a man - who knows? - thou wilt be grateful to Mahbub Ali.'</p>

<p>'Take me beyond their sentries where I can change this red.
Give me<br>
 money and I will go to Benares and be with my lama again. I do
not<br>
 want to be a Sahib, and remember I did deliver that
message.'</p>

<p>The stallion bounded wildly. Mahbub Ali had incautiously
driven<br>
 home the sharp-edged stirrup. (He was not the new sort of
fluent<br>
 horse-dealer who wears English boots and spurs.) Kim drew his
own<br>
 conclusions from that betrayal.</p>

<p>'That was a small matter. It lay on the straight road to
Benares. I<br>
 and the Sahib have by this time forgotten it. I send so many<br>
 letters and messages to men who ask questions about horses,
I<br>
 cannot well remember one from the other. Was it some matter of
a<br>
 bay mare that Peters Sahib wished the pedigree of?'</p>

<p>Kim saw the trap at once. If he had said 'bay mare' Mahbub
would<br>
 have known by his very readiness to fall in with the amendment
that<br>
 the boy suspected something. Kim replied therefore:</p>

<p>'Bay mare. No. I do not forget my messages thus. It was a
white<br>
 stallion.'</p>

<p>'Ay, so it was. A white Arab stallion. But thou didst write
"bay<br>
 mare" to me.'</p>

<p>'Who cares to tell truth to a letter-writer?' Kim answered,
feeling<br>
 Mahbub's palm on his heart.</p>

<p>'Hi! Mahbub, you old villain, pull up!' cried a voice, and
an<br>
 Englishman raced alongside on a little polo-pony. 'I've been<br>
 chasing you half over the country. That Kabuli of yours can go.
For<br>
 sale, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'I have some young stuff coming on made by Heaven for the
delicate<br>
 and difficult polo-game. He has no equal. He - '</p>

<p>'Plays polo and waits at table. Yes. We know all that. What
the<br>
 deuce have you got there?'</p>

<p>'A. boy,' said Mahbub gravely. 'He was being beaten by another
boy.<br>
 His father was once a white soldier in the big war. The boy was
a<br>
 child in Lahore city. He played with my horses when he was a
babe.<br>
 Now I think they will make him a soldier. He has been newly
caught<br>
 by his father's Regiment that went up to the war last week. But
I<br>
 do not think he wants to be a soldier. I take him for a ride.
Tell<br>
 me where thy barracks are and I will set thee there.'</p>

<p>'Let me go. I can find the barracks alone.'</p>

<p>'And if thou runnest away who will say it is not my
fault?'</p>

<p>'He'll run back to his dinner. Where has he to run to?'
the<br>
 Englishman asked.</p>

<p>'He was born in the land. He has friends. He goes where he
chooses.<br>
 He is a chabuk sawai [a sharp chap]. It needs only to change
his<br>
 clothing, and in a twinkling he would be a low-caste Hindu
boy.'</p>

<p>'The deuce he would!' The Englishman looked critically at the
boy<br>
 as Mahbub headed towards the barracks. Kim ground his teeth.
Mahbub<br>
 was mocking him, as faithless Afghans will; for he went on:</p>

<p>'They will send him to a school and put heavy boots on his
feet and<br>
 swaddle him in these clothes. Then he will forget all he
knows.<br>
 Now, which of the barracks is thine?'</p>

<p>Kim pointed - he could not speak - to Father Victor's wing,
all<br>
 staring white near by.</p>

<p>'Perhaps he will make a good soldier,' said Mahbub
reflectively.</p>

<p>'He will make a good orderly at least. I sent him to deliver
a<br>
 message once from Lahore. A message concerning the pedigree of
a<br>
 white stallion.'</p>

<p>Here was deadly insult on deadlier injury - and the Sahib to
whom<br>
 he had so craftily given that war-waking letter heard it all.
Kim<br>
 beheld Mahbub Ali frying in flame for his treachery, but for<br>
 himself he saw one long grey vista of barracks, schools, and<br>
 barracks again. He gazed imploringly at the clear-cut face in
which<br>
 there was no glimmer of recognition; but even at this extremity
it<br>
 never occurred to him to throw himself on the white man's mercy
or<br>
 to denounce the Afghan. And Mahbub stared deliberately at
the<br>
 Englishman, who stared as deliberately at Kim, quivering and<br>
 tongue-tied.</p>

<p>'My horse is well trained,' said the dealer. 'Others would
have<br>
 kicked, Sahib.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' said the Englishman at last, rubbing his pony's damp
withers<br>
 with his whip-butt. 'Who makes the boy a soldier?'</p>

<p>'He says the Regiment that found him, and especially the
Padre-<br>
 sahib of that regiment.</p>

<p>'There is the Padre!' Kim choked as bare-headed Father
Victor<br>
 sailed down upon them from the veranda.</p>

<p>'Powers O' Darkness below, O'Hara! How many more mixed friends
do<br>
 you keep in Asia?' he cried, as Kim slid down and stood
helplessly<br>
 before him.</p>

<p>'Good morning, Padre,' the Englishman said cheerily. 'I know
you by<br>
 reputation well enough. Meant to have come over and called
before<br>
 this. I'm Creighton.'</p>

<p>'Of the Ethnological Survey?' said Father Victor. The
Englishman<br>
 nodded. 'Faith, I'm glad to meet ye then; an' I owe you some
thanks<br>
 for bringing back the boy.'</p>

<p>'No thanks to me, Padre. Besides, the boy wasn't going away.
You<br>
 don't know old Mahbub Ali.' The horse-dealer sat impassive in
the<br>
 sunlight. 'You will when you have been in the station a month.
He<br>
 sells us all our crocks. That boy is rather a curiosity. Can
you<br>
 tell me anything about him?'</p>

<p>'Can I tell you?' puffed Father Victor. 'You'll be the one man
that<br>
 could help me in my quandaries. Tell you! Powers o' Darkness,
I'm<br>
 bursting to tell someone who knows something o' the native!'</p>

<p>A groom came round the corner. Colonel Creighton raised his
voice,<br>
 speaking in Urdu. 'Very good, Mahbub Ali, but what is the use
of<br>
 telling me all those stories about the pony? Not one pice more
than<br>
 three hundred and fifty rupees will I give.'</p>

<p>'The Sahib is a little hot and angry after riding,' the
horse-<br>
 dealer returned, with the leer of a privileged jester.
'Presently,<br>
 he will see my horse's points more clearly. I will wait till he
has<br>
 finished his talk with the Padre. I will wait under that
tree.'</p>

<p>'Confound you!' The Colonel laughed. 'That comes of looking at
one<br>
 of Mahbub's horses. He's a regular old leech, Padre. Wait, then,
if<br>
 thou hast so much time to spare, Mahbub. Now I'm at your
service,<br>
 Padre. Where is the boy? Oh, he's gone off to collogue with
Mahbub.<br>
 Queer sort of boy. Might I ask you to send my mare round
under<br>
 cover?'</p>

<p>He dropped into a chair which commanded a clear view of Kim
and<br>
 Mahbub Ali in conference beneath the tree. The Padre went
indoors<br>
 for cheroots.</p>

<p>Creighton heard Kim say bitterly: 'Trust a Brahmin before a
snake,<br>
 and a snake before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan,
Mahbub<br>
 Ali.'</p>

<br>
'That is all one.' The great red beard wagged solemnly. 'Children
<br>
should not see a carpet on the loom till the pattern is made
plain. <br>
Believe me, Friend of all the World, I do thee great service.
They <br>
will not make a soldier of thee.'

<p>'You crafty old sinner!' thought Creighton. 'But you're not
far<br>
 wrong. That boy mustn't be wasted if he is as advertised.'</p>

<p>'Excuse me half a minute,' cried the Padre from within, 'but
I'm<br>
 gettin' the documents in the case.</p>

<p>'If through me the favour of this bold and wise Colonel Sahib
comes<br>
 to thee, and thou art raised to honour, what thanks wilt thou
give<br>
 Mahbub Ali when thou art a man?'</p>

<p>'Nay, nay! I begged thee to let me take the Road again, where
I<br>
 should have been safe; and thou hast sold me back to the
English.<br>
 What will they give thee for blood-money?'</p>

<p>'A cheerful young demon!' The Colonel bit his cigar, and
turned<br>
 politely to Father Victor.</p>

<p>'What are the letters that the fat priest is waving before
the<br>
 Colonel? Stand behind the stallion as though looking at my
bridle!'<br>
 said Mahbub Ali.</p>

<p>'A letter from my lama which he wrote from Jagadhir Road,
saying<br>
 that he will pay three hundred rupees by the year for my<br>
 schooling.'</p>

<p>'Oho! Is old Red Hat of that sort? At which school?'</p>

<p>'God knows. I think in Nucklao.'</p>

<p>'Yes. There is a big school there for the sons of Sahibs -
and<br>
 half-Sahibs. I have seen it when I sell horses there. So the
lama<br>
 also loved the Friend of all the World?'</p>

<p>'Ay; and he did not tell lies, or return me to captivity.'</p>

<p>'Small wonder the Padre does not know how to unravel the
thread.<br>
 How fast he talks to the Colonel Sahib!' Mahbub Ali chuckled.
'By<br>
 Allah!' the keen eyes swept the veranda for an Instant - 'thy
lama<br>
 has sent what to me looks like a note of hand. I have had some
few<br>
 dealings in hoondis. The Colonel Sahib is looking at it.'</p>

<p>'What good is all this to me?' said Kim wearily. 'Thou wilt
go<br>
 away, and they will return me to those empty rooms where there
is<br>
 no good place to sleep and where the boys beat me.'</p>

<p>'I do not think that. Have patience, child. All Pathans are
not<br>
 faithless - except in horseflesh.'</p>

<p>Five - ten- fifteen minutes passed, Father Victor talking<br>
 energetically or asking questions which the Colonel
answered.</p>

<p>'Now I've told you everything that I know about the boy
from<br>
 beginnin to end; and it's a blessed relief to me. Did ye ever
hear<br>
 the like?'</p>

<p>'At any rate, the old man has sent the money. Gobind Sahai's
notes<br>
 of hand are good from here to China,' said the Colonel. 'The
more<br>
 one knows about natives the less can one say what they will
or<br>
 won't do.'</p>

<p>'That's consolin' - from the head of the Ethnological Survey.
It's<br>
 this mixture of Red Bulls and Rivers of Healing (poor heathen,
God<br>
 help him!) an' notes of hand and Masonic certificates. Are you
a<br>
 Mason, by any chance?'</p>

<p>'By Jove, I am, now I come to think of it. That's an
additional<br>
 reason,' said the Colonel absently.</p>

<p>'I'm glad ye see a reason in it. But as I said, it's the
mixture<br>
 o' things that's beyond me. An' his prophesyin' to our
Colonel,<br>
 sitting on my bed with his little shimmy torn open showing
his<br>
 white skin; an' the prophecy comin' true! They'll cure all
that<br>
 nonsense at St Xavier's, eh?'</p>

<p>'Sprinkle him with holy water' the Colonel laughed.</p>

<p>'On my word, I fancy I ought to sometimes. But I'm hoping
he'll be<br>
 brought up as a good Catholic. All that troubles me is
what'll<br>
 happen if the old beggar-man -'</p>

<p>'Lama, lama, my dear sir; and some of them are gentlemen in
their<br>
 own country</p>

<p>'The lama, then, fails to pay next year. He's a fine business
head<br>
 to plan on the spur of the moment, but he's bound to die some
day.<br>
 An' takin' a heathen's money to give a child a Christian
education<br>
 -'</p>

<p>'But he said explicitly what he wanted. As soon as he knew the
boy<br>
 was white he seems to have made his arrangements accordingly.
I'd<br>
 give a month's pay to hear how he explained it all at the<br>
 Tirthankars' Temple at Benares. Look here, Padre, I don't
pretend<br>
 to know much about natives, but if he says he'll pay, he'll pay
-<br>
 dead or alive. I mean, his heirs will assume the debt. My advice
to<br>
 you is, send the boy down to Lucknow. If your Anglican
Chaplain<br>
 thinks you've stolen a march on him -'</p>

<p>Bad luck to Bennett! He was sent to the Front instead O'
me.<br>
 Doughty certified me medically unfit. I'll excommunicate Doughty
if<br>
 he comes back alive! Surely Bennett ought to be content with
-,</p>

<p>'Glory, leaving you the religion. Quite so! As a matter of
fact I<br>
 don't think Bennett will mind. Put the blame on me. I - er -<br>
 strongly recommend sending the boy to St Xavier's. He can go
down<br>
 on pass as a soldier's orphan, so the railway fare will be
saved.<br>
 You can buy him an outfit from the Regimental subscription.
The<br>
 Lodge will be saved the expense of his education, and that will
put<br>
 the Lodge in a good temper. It's perfectly easy. I've got to
go<br>
 down to Lucknow next week. I'll look after the boy on the way
-<br>
 give him in charge of my servants, and so on.'</p>

<p>'You're a good man.</p>

<p>'Not in the least. Don't make that mistake. The lama has sent
us<br>
 money for a definite end. We can't very well return it. We
shall<br>
 have to do as he says. Well, that's settled, isn't it? Shall we
say<br>
 that, Tuesday next, you'll hand him over to me at the night
train<br>
 south? That's only three days. He can't do much harm in
three<br>
 days.'</p>

<p>'It's a weight off my mind, but - this thing here?' - he<br>
 waved the note of hand - 'I don't know Gobind Sahai: or his
bank,<br>
 which may be a hole in a wall.'</p>

<p>'You've never been a subaltern in debt. I'll cash it if
you<br>
 like, and send you the vouchers in proper order.'</p>

<p>'But with all your own work too! It's askin' -'</p>

<p>'It's not the least trouble indeed. You see, as an<br>
 ethnologist, the thing's very interesting to me. I'd like to
make a<br>
 note of it for some Government work that I'm doing. The<br>
 transformation of a regimental badge like your Red Bull into a
sort<br>
 of fetish that the boy follows is very interesting.'</p>

<p>'But I can't thank you enough.'</p>

<p>'There's one thing you can do. All we Ethnological men are
as<br>
 jealous as jackdaws of one another's discoveries. They're of
no<br>
 interest to anyone but ourselves, of course, but you know
what<br>
 book-collectors are like. Well, don't say a word, directly
or<br>
 indirectly, about the Asiatic side of the boy's character -
his<br>
 adventures and his prophecy, and so on. I'll worm them out of
the<br>
 boy later on and - you see?'</p>

<p>'I do. Ye'll make a wonderful account of it. Never a word will
I<br>
 say to anyone till I see it in print.'</p>

<p>'Thank you. That goes straight to an ethnologist's heart.
Well, I<br>
 must be getting back to my breakfast. Good Heavens! Old Mabbub
here<br>
 still?' He raised his voice, and the horse-dealer came out
from<br>
 under the shadow of the tree, 'Well, what is it?'</p>

<p>'As regards that young horse,' said Mahbub, 'I say that when a
colt<br>
 is born to be a polo-pony, closely following the ball
without<br>
 teaching - when such a colt knows the game by divination - then
I<br>
 say it is a great wrong to break that colt to a heavy cart,
Sahib!'</p>

<p>'So say I also, Mahbub. The colt will be entered for polo
only.<br>
 (These fellows think of nothing in the world but horses,
Padre.)<br>
 I'll see you tomorrow, Mahbub, if you've anything likely for
sale.'</p>

<p>The dealer saluted, horseman-fashion, with a sweep of the off
hand.<br>
 'Be patient a little, Friend of all the World,' he whispered
to<br>
 the agonized Kim. 'Thy fortune is made. In a little while
thou<br>
 goest to Nucklao, and - here is something to pay the
letter-writer.<br>
 I shall see thee again, I think, many times,' and he cantered
off<br>
 down the road.</p>

<p>'Listen to me,' said the Colonel from the veranda, speaking in
the<br>
 vernacular. 'In three days thou wilt go with me to Lucknow,
seeing<br>
 and hearing new things all the while. Therefore sit still for
three<br>
 days and do not run away. Thou wilt go to school at
Lucknow.'</p>

<p>'Shall I meet my Holy One there?' Kim whimpered.</p>

<p>'At least Lucknow is nearer to Benares than Umballa. It may be
thou<br>
 wilt go under my protection. Mahbub Ali knows this, and he will
be<br>
 angry if thou returnest to the Road now. Remember - much has
been<br>
 told me which I do not forget.'</p>

<p>'I will wait,' said Kim, 'but the boys will beat me.'</p>

<p>Then the bugles blew for dinner.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><br>
 Unto whose use the pregnant suns are poised<br>
 With idiot moons and stars retracing stars?<br>
 Creep thou betweene - thy coming's all unnoised.<br>
 Heaven hath her high, as Earth her baser, wars.<br>
 Heir to these tumults, this affright, that fraye<br>
 (By Adam's, fathers', own, sin bound alway);<br>
 Peer up, draw out thy horoscope and say<br>
 Which planet mends thy threadbare fate or mars?</p>

<p>Sir John Christie.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the red-faced schoolmaster told Kim that he
had<br>
 been 'struck off the strength', which conveyed no meaning to
him<br>
 till he was ordered to go away and play. Then he ran to the
bazar,<br>
 and found the young letter-writer to whom he owed a stamp.</p>

<p>'Now I pay,' said Kim royally, 'and now I need another letter
to be<br>
 written.'</p>

<p>'Mahbub Ali is in Umballa,' said the writer jauntily. He was,
by<br>
 virtue of his office, a bureau of general misinformation.</p>

<p><br>
 'This is not to Mahbub, but to a priest. Take thy pen and
write<br>
 quickly. To Teshoo La ma, the Holy One from Bhotiyal seeking for
a<br>
 River, who is now in the Temple ofihe Tirthankars at Benares.
Take<br>
 more ink! In three days I am to go down to Nucklao to the school
at<br>
 Nucklao. The name of the school is Xavier. I do not know where
that<br>
 school is, but it is at Nucklao.'</p>

<p>'But I know Nucklao,' the writer interrupted. 'I know the
school.'</p>

<p>'Tell him where it is, and I give half an anna.'</p>

<p>The reed pen scratched busily. 'He cannot mistake.' The man
lifted<br>
 his head. 'Who watches us across the street?'</p>

<p>Kim looked up hurriedly and saw Colonel Creighton in
tennis-<br>
 flannels.</p>

<p>'Oh, that is some Sahib who knows the fat priest in the
barracks.<br>
 He is beckoning me.'</p>

<p>'What dost thou?' said the Colonel, when Kim trotted up.</p>

<p>'I - I am not running away. I send a letter to my Holy One
at<br>
 Benares.'</p>

<p>'I had not thought of that. Hast thou said that I take thee
to<br>
 Lucknow?'</p>

<p>'Nay, I have not. Read the letter, if there be a doubt.'</p>

<p>'Then why hast thou left out my name in writing to that Holy
One?'<br>
 The Colonel smiled a queer smile. Kim took his courage in
both<br>
 hands.</p>

<p>'It was said once to me that it is inexpedient to write the
names<br>
 of strangers concerned in any matter, because by the naming
of<br>
 names many good plans are brought to confusion.'</p>

<p>'Thou hast been well taught,' the Colonel replied, and Kim
flushed.<br>
 'I have left my cheroot-case in the Padre's veranda. Bring it to
my<br>
 house this even.'</p>

<p>'Where is the house?' said Kim. His quick wit told him that he
was<br>
 being tested in some fashion or another, and he stood on
guard.</p>

<p>'Ask anyone in the big bazar.' The Colonel walked on.</p>

<p>'He has forgotten his cheroot-case,' said Kim, returning. 'I
must<br>
 bring it to him this evening. That is all my letter except,
thrice<br>
 over, Come to me! Come to me! Come to me! Now I will pay for
a<br>
 stamp and put it in the post. He rose to go, and as an
afterthought<br>
 asked: 'Who is that angry-faced Sahib who lost the
cheroot-case?'</p>

<p>'Oh, he is only Creighton Sahib - a very foolish Sahib, who is
a<br>
 Colonel Sahib without a regiment.'</p>

<p>'What is his business?'</p>

<p>'God knows. He is always buying horses which he cannot ride,
and<br>
 asking riddles about the works of God - such as plants and
stones<br>
 and the customs of people. The dealers call him the father
of<br>
 fools, because he is so easily cheated about a horse. Mahbub
Ali<br>
 says he is madder than most other Sahibs.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' said Kim, and departed. His training had given him some
small<br>
 knowledge of character, and he argued that fools are not
given<br>
 information which leads to calling out eight thousand men
besides<br>
 guns. The Commander-in-Chief of all India does not talk, as Kim
had<br>
 heard him talk, to fools. Nor would Mahbub Ali's tone have
changed,<br>
 as it did every time he mentioned the Colonel's name, if the<br>
 Colonel had been a fool. Consequently - and this set Kim to<br>
 skipping - there was a mystery somewhere, and Mahbub Ali
probably<br>
 spied for the Colonel much as Kim had spied for Mahbub. And,
like<br>
 the horse-dealer, the Colonel evidently respected people who
did<br>
 not show themselves to be too clever.</p>

<p><br>
 He rejoiced that he had not betrayed his knowledge of the
Colonel's<br>
 house; and when, on his return to barracks, he discovered that
no<br>
 cheroot-case had been left behind, he beamed with delight. Here
was<br>
 a man after his own heart - a tortuous and indirect person
playing<br>
 a hidden game. Well, if he could be a fool, so could Kim.</p>

<p>He showed nothing of his mind when Father Victor, for three
long<br>
 mornings, discoursed to him of an entirely new set of Gods
and<br>
 Godlings - notably of a Goddess called Mary, who, he gathered,
was<br>
 one with Bibi Miriam of Mahbub Ali's theology. He betrayed
no<br>
 emotion when, after the lecture, Father Victor dragged him
from<br>
 shop to shop buying articles of outfit, nor when envious
drummer-<br>
 boys kicked him because he was going to a superior school did
he<br>
 complain, but awaited the play of circumstances with an
interested<br>
 soul. Father Victor, good man, took him to the station, put
him<br>
 into an empty second-class next to Colonel Creighton's first,
and<br>
 bade him farewell with genuine feeling.</p>

<p>'They'll make a man o' you, O'Hara, at St Xavier's - a white
man,<br>
 an', I hope, a good man. They know all about your comin', an'
the<br>
 Colonel will see that ye're not lost or mislaid anywhere on
the<br>
 road. I've given you a notion of religious matters, - at least
I<br>
 hope so, - and you'll remember, when they ask you your
religion,<br>
 that you're a Cath'lic. Better say Roman Cath'lic, tho' I'm
not<br>
 fond of the word.'</p>

<p>Kim lit a rank cigarette - he had been careful to buy a stock
in<br>
 the bazar - and lay down to think. This solitary passage was
verv<br>
 different from that joyful down-journey in the third-class with
the<br>
 lama. 'Sahibs get little pleasure of travel,' he reflected.</p>

<p>'Hai mai! I go from one place to another as it might be a
kickball.<br>
 It is my Kismet. No man can escape his Kismet. But I am to pray
to<br>
 Bibi Miriam, and I am a Sahib.' He looked at his boots
ruefully.<br>
 'No; I am Kim. This is the great world, and I am only Kim. Who
is<br>
 Kim?' He considered his own identity, a thing he had never
done<br>
 before, till his head swam. He was one insignificant person in
all<br>
 this roaring whirl of India, going southward to he knew not
what<br>
 fate.</p>

<p>Presently the Colonel sent for him, and talked for a long
time. So<br>
 far as Kim could gather, he was to be diligent and enter the
Survey<br>
 of India as a chain-man. If he were very good, and passed
the<br>
 proper examinations, he would be earning thirty rupees a month
at<br>
 seventeen years old, and Colonel Creighton would see that he
found<br>
 suitable employment.</p>

<p>Kim pretended at first to understand perhaps one word in three
of<br>
 this talk. Then the Colonel, seeing his mistake, turned to
fluent<br>
 and picturesque Urdu and Kim was contented. No man could be a
fool<br>
 who knew the language so intimately, who moved so gently and<br>
 silently, and whose eyes were so different from the dull fat
eyes<br>
 of other Sahibs.</p>

<p>'Yes, and thou must learn how to make pictures of roads
and<br>
 mountains and rivers to carry these pictures in thine eye till
a<br>
 suitable time comes to set them upon paper. Perhaps some day,
when<br>
 thou art a chain-man, I may say to thee when we are working<br>
 together: "Go across those hills and see what lies beyond."
Then<br>
 one will say: "There are bad people living in those hills who
will<br>
 slay the chain-man if he be seen to look like a Sahib." What
then?'</p>

<p>Kim thought. Would it be safe to return the Colonel's
lead?</p>

<p>'I would tell what that other man had said.'</p>

<p>'But if I answered: "I will give thee a hundred rupees for<br>
 knowledge of what is behind those hills - for a picture of a
river<br>
 and a little news of what the people say in the villages
there"?'</p>

<p>'How can I tell? I am only a boy. Wait till I am a man.'
Then,<br>
 seeing the Colonel's brow clouded, he went on: 'But I think
I<br>
 should in a few days earn the hundred rupees.'</p>

<p>'By what road?'</p>

<p>Kim shook his head resolutely. 'If I said how I would earn
them,<br>
 another man might hear and forestall me. It is not good to
sell<br>
 knowledge for nothing.'</p>

<p>'Tell now.' The Colonel held up a rupee. Kim's hand half
reached<br>
 towards it, and dropped.</p>

<p>'Nay, Sahib; nay. I know the price that will be paid for
the<br>
 answer, but I do not know why the question is asked.'</p>

<p>'Take it for a gift, then,' said Creighton, tossing it over.
'There<br>
 is a good spirit in thee. Do not let it be blunted at St
Xavier's.<br>
 There are many boys there who despise the black men.'</p>

<p>'Their mothers were bazar-women,' said Kim. He knew well there
is<br>
 no hatred like that of the half-caste for his
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>'True; but thou art a Sahib and the son of a Sahib. Therefore,
do<br>
 not at any time be led to contemn the black men. I have known
boys<br>
 newly entered into the service of the Government who feigned not
to<br>
 understand the talk or the customs of black men. Their pay was
cut<br>
 for ignorance. There is no sin so great as ignorance.
Remember<br>
 this.'</p>

<p>Several times in the course of the long twenty-four hours'
run<br>
 south did the Colonel send for Kim, always developing this
latter<br>
 text.</p>

<p>'We be all on one lead-rope, then,' said Kim at last, 'the
Colonel,<br>
 Mahbub Ali, and I - when I become a chain-man. He will use me
as<br>
 Mahbub Ali employed me, I think. That is good, if it allows me
to<br>
 return to the Road again. This clothing grows no easier by
wear.'</p>

<p>When they came to the crowded Lucknow station there was no
sign of<br>
 the lama. He swallowed his disappointment, while the Colonel<br>
 bundled him into a ticca-gharri with his neat belongings and<br>
 despatched him alone to St Xavier's.</p>

<p>'I do not say farewell, because we shall meet again,' he
cried.<br>
 'Again, and many times, if thou art one of good spirit. But
thou<br>
 art not yet tried.'</p>

<p>'Not when I brought thee' - Kim actually dared to use the tum
of<br>
 equals - 'a white stallion's pedigree that night?'</p>

<p>'Much is gained by forgetting, little brother,' said the
Colonel,<br>
 with a look that pierced through Kim's shoulder-blades as he<br>
 scuttled into the carriage.</p>

<p>It took him nearly five minutes to recover. Then he sniffed
the new<br>
 air appreciatively. 'A rich city,' he said. 'Richer than
Lahore.<br>
 How good the bazars must be! Coachman, drive me a little
through<br>
 the bazars here.'</p>

<p>'My order is to take thee to the school.' The driver used
the<br>
 'thou', which is rudeness when applied to a white man. In
the<br>
 clearest and most fluent vernacular Kim pointed out his
error,<br>
 climbed on to the box-seat, and, perfect understanding
established,<br>
 drove for a couple of hours up and down, estimating, comparing,
and<br>
 enjoying. There is no city - except Bombay, the queen of all -
more<br>
 beautiful in her garish style than Lucknow, whether you see
her<br>
 from the bridge over the river, or from the top of the
Imambara<br>
 looking down on the gilt umbrellas of the Chutter Munzil, and
the<br>
 trees in which the town is bedded. Kings have adorned her
with<br>
 fantastic buildings, endowed her with charities, crammed her
with<br>
 pensioners, and drenched her with blood. She is the centre of
all<br>
 idleness, intrigue, and luxury, and shares with Delhi the claim
to<br>
 talk the only pure Urdu.</p>

<p>'A fair city - a beautiful city.' The driver, as a Lucknow
man, was<br>
 pleased with the compliment, and told Kim many astounding
things<br>
 where an English guide would have talked of the Mutiny.</p>

<p>'Now we will go to the school,' said Kim at last. The great
old<br>
 school of St Xavier's in Partibus, block on block of low
white<br>
 buildings, stands in vast grounds over against the Gumti River,'
at<br>
 some distance from the city.</p>

<p>'What like of folk are they within?' said Kim.</p>

<p>'Young Sahibs - all devils. But to speak truth, and I drive
many of<br>
 them to and fro from the railway station, I have never seen
one<br>
 that had in him the making of a more perfect devil than thou -
this<br>
 young Sahib whom I am now driving.'</p>

<p>Naturally, for he was never trained to consider them in any
way<br>
 improper, Kim had passed the time of day with one or two
frivolous<br>
 ladies at upper windows in a certain street, and naturally, in
the<br>
 exchange of compliments, had acquitted himself well. He was
about<br>
 to acknowledge the driver's last insolence, when his eye - it
was<br>
 growing dusk - caught a figure sitting by one of the white
plaster<br>
 gate-pillars in the long sweep of wall.</p>

<p>'Stop!' he cried. 'Stay here. I do not go to the school at
once.'</p>

<p>'But what is to pay me for this coming and re-coming?' said
the<br>
 driver petulantly. 'Is the boy mad? Last time it was a
dancing-<br>
 girl. This time it is a priest.'</p>

<p>Kim was in the road headlong, patting the dusty feet beneath
the<br>
 dirty yellow robe.</p>

<p>'I have waited here a day and a half,' the lama's level
voice<br>
 began. 'Nay, I had a disciple with me. He that was my friend at
the<br>
 Temple of the Tirthankars gave me a guide for this journey. I
came<br>
 from Benares in the te-rain, when thy letter was given me. Yes,
I<br>
 am well fed. I need nothing.'</p>

<p>'But why didst thou not stay with the Kulu woman, O Holy One?
In<br>
 what way didst thou get to Benares? My heart has been heavy
since<br>
 we parted.'</p>

<p>'The woman wearied me by constant flux of talk and requiring
charms<br>
 for children. I separated myself from that company, permitting
her<br>
 to acquire merit by gifts. She is at least a woman of open
hands,<br>
 and I made a promise to return to her house if need arose.
Then,<br>
 perceiving myself alone in this great and terrible world, I<br>
 bethought me of the te-rain to Benares, where I knew one abode
in<br>
 the Tirthankars' Temple who was a Seeker, even as I.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Thy River,' said Kim. 'I had forgotten the River.'</p>

<p>'So soon, my chela? I have never forgotten it. But when I had
left<br>
 thee it seemed better that I should go to the Temple and
take<br>
 counsel, for, look you, India is very large, and it may be
that<br>
 wise men before us, some two or three, have left a record of
the<br>
 place of our River. There is debate in the Temple of the<br>
 Tirthankars on this matter; some saying one thing, and some<br>
 another. They are courteous folk.'</p>

<p>'So be it; but what dost thou do now?'</p>

<p>'I acquire merit in that I help thee, my chela, to wisdom.
The<br>
 priest of that body of men who serve the Red Bull wrote me that
all<br>
 should be as I desired for thee. I sent the money to suffice
for<br>
 one year, and then I came, as thou seest me, to watch for
thee<br>
 going up into the Gates of Learning. A day and a half have I
waited<br>
 not because I was led by any affection towards thee - that is
no<br>
 part of the Way - but, as they said at the Tirthankars'
Temple,<br>
 because, money having been paid for learning, it was right that
I<br>
 should oversee the end of the matter. They resolved my doubts
most<br>
 clearly. I had a fear that, perhaps, I came because I wished to
see<br>
 thee - misguided by the Red Mist of affection. It is not so . .
.<br>
 Moreover, I am troubled by a dream.'</p>

<p>'But surely, Holy One, thou hast not forgotten the Road and
all<br>
 that befell on it. Surely it was a little to see me that thou
didst<br>
 come?'</p>

<p>'The horses are cold, and it is past their feeding-time,'
whined<br>
 the driver.</p>

<p>'Go to Jehannum and abide there with thy reputationless aunt!'
Kim<br>
 snarled over his shoulder. 'I am all alone in this land; I know
not<br>
 where I go nor what shall befall me. My heart was in that letter
I<br>
 sent thee. Except for Mahbub Ali, and he is a Pathan, I have
no<br>
 friend save thee, Holy One. Do not altogether go away.'</p>

<p>'I have considered that also,' the lama replied, in a
shaking<br>
 voice. 'It is manifest that from time to time I shall acquire
merit<br>
 if before that I have not found my River - by assuring
myself<br>
 that thy feet are set on wisdom. What they will teach thee I
do<br>
 not know, but the priest wrote me that no son of a Sahib in
all<br>
 India will be better taught than thou. So from time to time,<br>
 therefore, I will come again. Maybe thou wilt be such a Sahib as
he<br>
 who gave me these spectacles' - the lama wiped them elaborately
-<br>
 'in the Wonder House at Lahore. That is my hope, for he was
a<br>
 Fountain of Wisdom - wiser than many abbots .... Again, maybe
thou<br>
 wilt forget me and our meetings.'</p>

<p>'If I eat thy bread,' cried Kim passionately, 'how shall I
ever<br>
 forget thee?' 'No - no.' He put the boy aside. 'I must go back
to<br>
 Benares. From time to time,now that I know the customs of
letter-<br>
 writers in this land, I will send thee a letter, and from time
to<br>
 time I will come and see thee.'</p>

<p>'But whither shall I send my letters?' wailed Kim, clutching
at the<br>
 robe, all forgetful that he was a Sahib.</p>

<p>'To the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares. That is the
place I<br>
 have chosen till I find my River. Do not weep; for, look you,
all<br>
 Desire is Illusion and a new binding upon the Wheel. Go up to
the<br>
 Gates of Learning. Let me see thee go . .. Dost thou love me?
Then<br>
 go, or my heart cracks .. . I will come again. Surely I will
come<br>
 again.</p>

<p>The lama watched the ticca-gharri rumble into the compound,
and<br>
 strode off, snuffing between each long stride.</p>

<p>'The Gates of Learning' shut with a clang.</p>

<p>The country born and bred boy has his own manners and
customs,<br>
 which do not resemble those of any other land; and his
teachers<br>
 approach him by roads which an English master would not
understand.<br>
 Therefore, you would scarcely be interested in Kim's experiences
as<br>
 a St Xavier's boy among two or three hundred precocious
youths,<br>
 most of whom had never seen the sea. He suffered the usual<br>
 penalties for breaking out of bounds when there was cholera in
the<br>
 city. This was before he had learned to write fair English, and
so<br>
 was obliged to find a bazar letter-writer. He was, of
course,<br>
 indicted for smoking and for the use of abuse more
full-flavoured<br>
 than even St Xavier's had ever heard. He learned to wash
himself<br>
 with the Levitical scrupulosity of the native-born, who in
his<br>
 heart considers the Englishman rather dirty. He played the
usual<br>
 tricks on the patient coolies pulling the punkahs in the
sleeping-<br>
 rooms where the boys threshed through the hot nights telling
tales<br>
 till the dawn; and quietly he measured himself against his
self-<br>
 reliant mates.</p>

<p>They were sons of subordinate officials in the Railway,
Telegraph,<br>
 and Canal Services; of warrant-officers, sometimes retired
and<br>
 sometimes acting as commanders-in-chief to a feudatory
Rajah's<br>
 army; of captains of the Indian Marine Government
pensioners,<br>
 planters, Presidency shopkeepers, and missionaries. A few
were<br>
 cadets of the old Eurasian houses that have taken strong root
in<br>
 Dhurrumtollah - Pereiras, De Souzas, and D'Silvas. Their
parents<br>
 could well have educated them in England, but they loved the
school<br>
 that had served their own youth, and generation followed
sallow-<br>
 hued generation at St Xavier's. Their homes ranged from Howrah
of<br>
 the railway people to abandoned cantonments like Monghyr and<br>
 Chunar; lost tea-gardens Shillong-way; villages where their
fathers<br>
 were large landholders in Oudh or the Deccan; Mission-stations
a<br>
 week from the nearest railway line; seaports a thousand
miles<br>
 south, facing the brazen Indian surf; and
cinchona-plantations<br>
 south of all. The mere story of their adventures, which to
them<br>
 were no adventures, on their road to and from school would
have<br>
 crisped a Western boy's hair. They were used to jogging off
alone<br>
 through a hundred miles of jungle, where there was always
the<br>
 delightful chance of being delayed by tigers; but they would
no<br>
 more have bathed in the English Channel in an English August
than<br>
 their brothers across the world would have lain still while
a<br>
 leopard snuffed at their palanquin. There were boys of fifteen
who<br>
 had spent a day and a half on an islet in the middle of a
flooded<br>
 river, taking charge, as by right, of a camp of frantic
pilgrims<br>
 returning from a shrine. There were seniors who had
requisitioned a<br>
 chance-met Rajah's elephant, in the name of St Francis Xavier,
when<br>
 the Rains once blotted out the cart-track that led to their<br>
 father's estate, and had all but lost the huge beast in a<br>
 quicksand. There was a boy who, he said, and none doubted,
had<br>
 helped his father to beat off with rifles from the veranda a
rush<br>
 of Akas in the days when those head-hunters were bold
against<br>
 lonely plantations.</p>

<p><br>
 And every tale was told in the even, passionless voice of
the<br>
 native-born, mixed with quaint reflections, borrowed
unconsciously<br>
 from native foster-mothers, and turns of speech that showed
they<br>
 had been that instant translated from the vernacular. Kim
watched,<br>
 listened, and approved. This was not insipid, single-word talk
of<br>
 drummer-boys. It dealt with a life he knew and in part
understood.<br>
 The atmosphere suited him, and he throve by inches. They gave
him a<br>
 white drill suit as the weather warmed, and he rejoiced in the
new-<br>
 found bodily comforts as he rejoiced to use his sharpened mind
over<br>
 the tasks they set him. His quickness would have delighted
an<br>
 English master; but at St Xavier's they know the first rush
of<br>
 minds developed by sun and surroundings, as they know the
half-<br>
 collapse that sets in at twenty-two or twenty-three.</p>

<p>None the less he remembered to hold himself lowly. When tales
were<br>
 told of hot nights, Kim did not sweep the board with his<br>
 reminiscences; for St Xavier's looks down on boys who 'go
native<br>
 all-together.' One must never forget that one is a Sahib, and
that<br>
 some day, when examinations are passed, one will command
natives.<br>
 Kim made a note of this, for he began to understand where<br>
 examinations led.</p>

<p>Then came the holidays from August to October - the long
holidays<br>
 imposed by the heat and the Rains. Kim was informed that he
would<br>
 go north to some station in the hills behind Umballa, where
Father<br>
 Victor would arrange for him.</p>

<p>'A barrack-school?' said Kim, who had asked many questions
and<br>
 thought more.</p>

<p>'Yes, I suppose so,' said the master. 'It will not do you any
harm<br>
 to keep you out of mischief. You can go up with young De Castro
as<br>
 far as Delhi.'</p>

<p>Kim considered it in every possible light. He had been
diligent,<br>
 even as the Colonel advised. A boy's holiday was his own
property -<br>
 of so much the talk of his companions had advised him, - and
a<br>
 barrack-school would be torment after St Xavier's. Moreover -
this<br>
 was magic worth anything else - he could write. In three months
he<br>
 had discovered how men can speak to each other without a
third<br>
 party, at the cost of half an anna and a little knowledge. No
word<br>
 had come from the lama, but there remained the Road. Kim
yearned<br>
 for the caress of soft mud squishing up between the toes, as
his<br>
 mouth watered for mutton stewed with butter and cabbages, for
rice<br>
 speckled with strong scented cardamoms, for the
saffron-tinted<br>
 rice, garlic and onions, and the forbidden greasy sweetmeats of
the<br>
 bazars. They would feed him raw beef on a platter at the
barrack-<br>
 school, and he must smoke by stealth. But again, he was a Sahib
and<br>
 was at St Xavier's, and that pig Mahbub Ali ... No, he would
not<br>
 test Mahbub's hospitality - and yet ... He thought</p>

<p>it out alone in the dormitory, and came to the conclusion he
had<br>
 been unjust to Mahbub.</p>

<p>The school was empty; nearly all the masters had gone away;
Colonel<br>
 Creighton 's railway pass lay in his hand, and Kim puffed
himself<br>
 that he had not spent Colonel Creighton 's or Mahbub's money
in<br>
 riotous living. He was still lord of two rupees seven annas.
His<br>
 new bullock-trunk, marked 'K. O'H.', and bedding-roll lay in
the<br>
 empty sleeping-room. 'Sahibs are always tied to their
baggage,'<br>
 said Kim, nodding at them. 'You will stay here' He went out
into<br>
 the warm rain, smiling sinfully, and sought a certain house
whose<br>
 outside he had noted down some time before. . .</p>

<p>'Arre'! Dost thou know what manner of women we be in this
quarter?<br>
 Oh, shame!'</p>

<p>'Was I born yesterday?' Kim squatted native-fashion on the
cushions<br>
 of that upper room. 'A little dyestuff and three yards of cloth
to<br>
 help out a jest. Is it much to ask?'</p>

<p>'Who is she? Thou art full young, as Sahibs go, for this
devilry.'</p>

<p>'Oh, she? She is the daughter of a certain schoolmaster of
a</p>

<p>regiment in the cantonments. He has beaten me twice because
I</p>

<p>went over their wall in these clothes. Now I would go as a</p>

<p>gardener's boy. Old men are very jealous.'</p>

<p>'That is true. Hold thy face still while I dab on the
juice.'</p>

<p>'Not too black, Naikan. I would not appear to her as a
hubshi<br>
 [nigger).'</p>

<p>'Oh, love makes nought of these things. And how old is
she?'</p>

<p>'Twelve years, I think,' said the shameless Kim. 'Spread it
also on<br>
 the breast. It may be her father will tear my clothes off me,
and<br>
 if I am piebald -' he laughed.</p>

<p>The girl worked busily, dabbing a twist of cloth into a
little<br>
 saucer of brown dye that holds longer than any walnut-juice.</p>

<p>'Now send out and get me a cloth for the turban. Woe is me, my
head<br>
 is all unshaved! And he will surely knock off my turban.'</p>

<p>'I am not a barber, but I will make shift. Thou wast born to
be a<br>
 breaker of hearts! All this disguise for one evening? Remember,
the<br>
 stuff does not wash away.' She shook with laughter till her<br>
 bracelets and anklets jingled. 'But who is to pay me for
this?<br>
 Huneefa herself could not have given thee better stuff.'</p>

<p>'Trust in the Gods, my sister,' said Kim gravely, screwing his
face<br>
 round as the stain dried. 'Besides, hast thou ever helped to
paint<br>
 a Sahib thus before?'</p>

<p>'Never indeed. But a jest is not money.'</p>

<p>'It is worth much more.'</p>

<p>'Child, thou art beyond all dispute the most shameless son
of<br>
 Shaitan that I have ever known to take up a poor girl's time
with<br>
 this play, and then to say: "Is not the jest enough?" Thou wilt
go<br>
 very far in this world.' She gave the dancing-girls' salutation
in<br>
 mockery.</p>

<p>'All one. Make haste and rough-cut my head.' Kim shifted from
foot<br>
 to foot, his eyes ablaze with mirth as he thought of the fat
days<br>
 before him. He gave the girl four annas, and ran down the stairs
in<br>
 the likeness of a low-caste Hindu boy -perfect in every detail.
A<br>
 cookshop was his next point of call, where he feasted in<br>
 extravagance and greasy luxury.</p>

<p>On Lucknow station platform he watched young De Castro, all
covered<br>
 with prickly-heat, get into a second-class compartment. Kim<br>
 patronized a third, and was the life and soul of it. He
explained<br>
 to the company that he was assistant to a juggler who had left
him<br>
 behind sick with fever, and that he would pick up his master
at<br>
 Umballa. As the occupants of the carriage changed, he varied
this<br>
 tale, or adorned it with all the shoots of a budding fancy,
the<br>
 more rampant for being held off native speech so long. In all
India<br>
 that night was no human being so joyful as Kim. At Umballa he
got<br>
 out and headed eastward, plashing over the sodden fields to
the<br>
 village where the old soldier lived.</p>

<p>About this time Colonel Creighton at Simla was advised from
Lucknow<br>
 by wire that young O'Hara had disappeared. Mahbub Ali was in
town<br>
 selling horses, and to him the Colonel confided the affair
one<br>
 morning cantering round Annandale racecourse.</p>

<p>'Oh, that is nothing,' said the horse-dealer. 'Men are like
horses.<br>
 At certain times they need salt, and if that salt is not in
the<br>
 mangers they will lick it up from the earth. He has gone back
to<br>
 the Road again for a while. The madrissak wearied him. I knew
it<br>
 would. Another time, I will take him upon the Road myself. Do
not<br>
 be troubled, Creighton Sahib. It is as though a polo-pony,
breaking<br>
 loose, ran out to learn the game alone.'</p>

<p>'Then he is not dead, think you?'</p>

<p>'Fever might kill him. I do not fear for the boy otherwise.
A<br>
 monkey does not fall among trees.'</p>

<p>Next morning, on the same course, Mahbub's stallion ranged<br>
 alongside the Colonel.</p>

<p>'It is as I had thought,' said the horse-dealer. 'He has
come<br>
 through Umballa at least, and there he has written a letter to
me,<br>
 having learned in the bazar that I was here.'</p>

<p>'Read,' said the Colonel, with a sigh of relief. It was absurd
that<br>
 a man of his position should take an interest in a little
country-<br>
 bred vagabond; but the Colonel remembered the conversation in
the<br>
 train, and often in the past few months had caught himself
thinking<br>
 of the queer, silent, self-possessed boy. His evasion, of
course,<br>
 was the height of insolence, but it argued some resource and
nerve.</p>

<p>Mahbub's eyes twinkled as he reined out into the centre of
the<br>
 cramped little plain, where none could come near unseen.</p>

<p>'"The Friend of the Stars, who is the Friend of all the
World-"'</p>

<p>'What is this?'</p>

<p>'A name we give him in Lahore city. "The Friend of all the
World<br>
 takes leave to go to his own places. He will come back upon
the<br>
 appointed day. Let the box and the bedding-roll be sent for; and
if<br>
 there has been a fault, let the Hand of Friendship turn aside
the<br>
 Whip of Calamity." There is yet a little more, but-'</p>

<p>'No matter, read.'</p>

<p>'"Certain things are not known to those who eat with forks. It
is<br>
 better to eat with both hands for a while. Speak soft words
to<br>
 those who do not understand this that the return may be<br>
 propitious." Now the manner in which that was cast is, of
course,<br>
 the work of the letter-writer, but see how wisely the boy
has<br>
 devised the matter of it so that no hint is given except to
those<br>
 who know!'</p>

<p>'Is this the Hand of Friendship to avert the Whip of
Calamity?'<br>
 laughed the Colonel.</p>

<p>'See how wise is the boy. He would go back to the Road again,
as I<br>
 said. Not knowing yet thy trade -'</p>

<p>'I am not at all sure of that,' the Colonel muttered.</p>

<p>'He turns to me to make a peace between you. Is he not wise?
He<br>
 says he will return. He is but perfecting his knowledge.
Think,<br>
 Sahib! He has been three months at the school. And he is not<br>
 mouthed to that bit. For my part, I rejoice. The pony learns
the<br>
 game.'</p>

<p>'Ay, but another time he must not go alone.'</p>

<p>'Why? He went alone before he came under the Colonel
Sahib's<br>
 protection. When he comes to the Great Game he must go alone
-<br>
 alone, and at peril of his head. Then, if he spits, or sneezes,
or<br>
 sits down other than as the people do whom he watches, he may
be<br>
 slain. Why hinder him now? Remember how the Persians say:
The<br>
 jackal that lives in the wilds of Mazanderan can only be caught
by<br>
 the hounds of Mazanderan.'</p>

<p>'True. It is true, Mahbub Ali. And if he comes to no harm, I
do not<br>
 desire anything better. But it is great insolence on his
part.'</p>

<p>'He does not tell me, even, whither he goes,' said Mahbub. 'He
is<br>
 no fool. When his time is accomplished he will come to me. It
is<br>
 time the healer of pearls took him in hand. He ripens too
quickly -<br>
 as Sahibs reckon.'</p>

<p>This prophecy was fulfilled to the letter a month later.
Mahbub had<br>
 gone down to Umballa to bring up a fresh consignment of horses,
and<br>
 Kim met him on the Kalka road at dusk riding alone, begged an
alms<br>
 of him, was sworn at, and replied in English. There was
nobody<br>
 within earshot to hear Mahbub's gasp of amazement.</p>

<p>'Oho! And where hast thou been?' 'Up and down - down and
up.'</p>

<p>'Come under a tree, out of the wet, and tell.' 'I stayed for
a<br>
 while with an old man near Umballa; anon with a household of
my<br>
 acquaintance in Umballa. With one of these I went as far as
Delhi<br>
 to the southward. That is a wondrous city. Then I drove a
bullock<br>
 for a teli [an oilman] coming north; but I heard of a great
feast<br>
 forward in Patiala, and thither went I in the company of a<br>
 firework-maker. It was a great feast' (Kim rubbed his stomach).
'I<br>
 saw Rajahs, and elephants with gold and silver trappings; and
they<br>
 lit all the fireworks at once, whereby eleven men were killed,
my<br>
 fire-work-maker among them, and I was blown across a tent but
took<br>
 no harm. Then I came back to the rel with a Sikh horseman, to
whom<br>
 I was groom for my bread; and so here.'</p>

<p>'Shabash!' said Mahbub Ali.</p>

<p>'But what does the Colonel Sahib say? I do not wish to be
beaten.</p>

<p>'The Hand of Friendship has averted the Whip of Calamity;
but<br>
 another time, when thou takest the Road it will be with me. This
is<br>
 too early.'</p>

<p>'Late enough for me. I have learned to read and to write
English a<br>
 little at the madrissah. I shall soon be altogether a
Sahib.'</p>

<p>'Hear him!' laughed Mahbub, looking at the little drenched
figure<br>
 dancing in the wet. 'Salaam - Sahib,' and he saluted
ironically.<br>
 'Well, art tired of the Road, or wilt thou come on to Umballa
with<br>
 me and work back with the horses?'</p>

<p>'I come with thee, Mahbub Ali.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><br>
 Something I owe to the soil that grew -<br>
 More to the life that fed -<br>
 But most to Allah Who gave me two<br>
 Separate sides to my head.</p>

<p>I would go without shirts or shoes,<br>
 Friends, tobacco or bread<br>
 Sooner than for an instant lose<br>
 Either side of my head.'</p>

<p>The Two-Sided Man.</p>

<p><br>
 'Then in God's name take blue for red,' said Mahbub, alluding
to<br>
 the Hindu colour of Kim's disreputable turban.</p>

<p>Kim countered with the old proverb, 'I will change my faith
and my<br>
 bedding, but thou must pay for it.'</p>

<p>The dealer laughed till he nearly fell from his horse. At a
shop on<br>
 the outskirts of the city the change was made, and Kim stood
up,<br>
 externally at least, a Mohammedan.</p>

<p>Mahbub hired a room over against the railway station, sent for
a<br>
 cooked meal of the finest with the almond-curd sweet-meats<br>
 [balushai we call it] and fine-chopped Lucknow tobacco.</p>

<p><br>
 'This is better than some other meat that I ate with the
Sikh,'<br>
 said Kim, grinning as he squatted, 'and assuredly they give no
such<br>
 victuals at my madrissah.'</p>

<p>'I have a desire to hear of that same madrissah.' Mahbub
stuffed<br>
 himself with great boluses of spiced mutton fried in fat
with<br>
 cabbage and golden-brown onions. 'But tell me first, altogether
and<br>
 truthfully, the manner of thy escape. For, O Friend of all
the<br>
 World,' - he loosed his cracking belt - 'I do not think it
is<br>
 often that a Sahib and the son of a Sahib runs away from
there.'</p>

<p>'How should they? They do not know the land. It was nothing,'
said<br>
 Kim, and began his tale. When he came to the disguisement and
the<br>
 interview with the girl in the bazar, Mahbub Ali's gravity
went<br>
 from him. He laughed aloud and beat his hand on his thigh.</p>

<p>'Shabash! Shabash! Oh, well done, little one! What will the
healer<br>
 of turquoises say to this? Now, slowly, let us hear what
befell<br>
 afterwards - step by step, omitting nothing.'</p>

<p>Step by step then, Kim told his adventures between coughs as
the<br>
 full-flavoured tobacco caught his lungs.</p>

<p>'I said,' growled Mahbub Ali to himself, 'I said it was the
pony<br>
 breaking out to play polo. The fruit is ripe already -except
that<br>
 he must learn his distances and his pacings, and his rods and
his<br>
 compasses. Listen now. I have turned aside the Colonel's whip
from<br>
 thy skin, and that is no small service.'</p>

<p>'True.' Kim pulled serenely. 'That is true.'</p>

<p>'But it is not to be thought that this running out and in is
any<br>
 way good.'</p>

<p>'It was my holiday, Hajji. I was a slave for many weeks. Why
should<br>
 I not run away when the school was shut? Look, too, how I,
living<br>
 upon my friends or working for my bread, as I did with the
Sikh,<br>
 have saved the Colonel Sahib a great expense.'</p>

<p>Mahbub's lips twitched under his well-pruned Mohammedan
moustache.</p>

<p>'What are a few rupees' - the Pathan threw out his open
hand<br>
 carelessly - 'to the Colonel Sahib? He spends them for a
purpose,<br>
 not in any way for love of thee.'</p>

<p>'That,' said Kim slowly, 'I knew a very long time ago.'</p>

<p>'Who told?'</p>

<p>'The Colonel Sahib himself. Not in those many words, but
plainly<br>
 enough for one who is not altogether a mud-head. Yea, he told me
in<br>
 the te-rain when we went down to Lucknow.'</p>

<p>'Be it so. Then I will tell thee more, Friend of all the
World,<br>
 though in the telling I lend thee my head.'</p>

<p>'It was forfeit to me,' said Kim, with deep relish, 'in
Umballa,<br>
 when thou didst pick me up on the horse after the drummer-boy
beat<br>
 me.'</p>

<p>'Speak a little plainer. All the world may tell lies save thou
and<br>
 I. For equally is thy life forfeit to me if I chose to raise
my<br>
 finger here.'</p>

<p>'And this is known to me also,' said Kim, readjusting the
live<br>
 charcoal-ball on the weed. 'It is a very sure tie between
us.<br>
 Indeed, thy hold is surer even than mine; for who would miss a
boy<br>
 beaten to death, or, it may be, thrown into a well by the
roadside?<br>
 Most people here and in Simla and across the passes behind
the<br>
 Hills would, on the other hand, say: "What has come to Mahbub
Ali?"<br>
 if he were found dead among his horses. Surely, too, the
Colonel<br>
 Sahib would make inquiries. But again,'- Kim's face puckered
with<br>
 cunning, - 'he would not make overlong inquiry, lest people
should<br>
 ask: "What has this Colonel Sahib to do with that
horse-dealer?"<br>
 But I - if I lived -,</p>

<p>'As thou wouldst surely die -,</p>

<p>'Maybe; but I say, if I lived, I, and I alone, would know that
one<br>
 had come by night, as a common thief perhaps, to Mahbub
Ali's<br>
 bulkhead in the serai, and there had slain him, either before
or<br>
 after that thief had made a full search into his saddlebags
and<br>
 between the soles of his slippers. Is that news to tell to
the<br>
 Colonel, or would he say to me - (I have not forgotten when he
sent<br>
 me back for a cigar-case that he had not left behind him) -
"What<br>
 is Mahbub Ali to me?"?'</p>

<p>Up went a gout of heavy smoke. There was a long pause: then
Mahbub<br>
 Ali spoke in admiration: 'And with these things on thy mind,
dost<br>
 thou lie down and rise again among all the Sahibs' little sons
at<br>
 the madrissah and meekly take instruction from thy
teachers?'</p>

<p>'It is an order,' said Kim blandly. 'Who am I to dispute an
order?'</p>

<p>'A most finished Son of Eblis,' said Mahbub Ali. 'But what is
this<br>
 tale of the thief and the search?'</p>

<p>'That which I saw,' said Kim, 'the night that my lama and I
lay<br>
 next thy place in the Kashmir Seral. The door was left
unlocked,<br>
 which I think is not thy custom, Mahbub. He came in as one
assured<br>
 that thou wouldst not soon return. My eye was against a
knot-hole<br>
 in the plank. He searched as it were for something - not a rug,
not<br>
 stirrups, nor a bridle, nor brass pots- something little and
most<br>
 carefully hid. Else why did he prick with an iron between the
soles<br>
 of thy slippers?'</p>

<p>'Ha!' Mahbub Ali smiled gently. 'And seeing these things, what
tale<br>
 didst thou fashion to thyself, Well of the Truth?'</p>

<p>'None. I put my hand upon my amulet, which lies always next to
my<br>
 skin, and, remembering the pedigree of a white stallion that I
had<br>
 bitten out of a piece of Mussalmani bread, I went away to
Umballa<br>
 perceiving that a heavy trust was laid upon me. At that hour,
had I<br>
 chosen, thy head was forfeit. It needed only to say to that man,
"I<br>
 have here a paper concerning a horse which I cannot read."
And<br>
 then?' Kim peered at Mahbub under his eyebrows.</p>

<p>'Then thou wouldst have drunk water twice - perhaps
thrice,<br>
 afterwards. I do not think more than thrice,' said Mahbub
simply.</p>

<p>'It is true. I thought of that a little, but most I thought
that I<br>
 loved thee, Mahbub. Therefore I went to Umballa, as thou
knowest,<br>
 but (and this thou dost not know) I lay hid in the garden-grass
to<br>
 see what Colonel Creighton Sahib might do upon reading the
white<br>
 stallion's pedigree.'</p>

<p>'And what did he?' for Kim had bitten off the
conversation.</p>

<p>'Dost thou give news for love, or dost thou sell it?' Kim
asked.</p>

<p>'I sell and - I buy.' Mahbub took a four-anna piece out of his
belt<br>
 and held it up.</p>

<p>'Eight!' said Kim, mechanically following the huckster
instinct of<br>
 the East.</p>

<p>Mahbub laughed, and put away the coin. It is too easy to deal
in<br>
 that market, Friend of all the World. Tell me for love. Our
lives<br>
 lie in each other's hand.'</p>

<p>'Very good. I saw the Jang-i-Lat Sahib [the
Commander-in-Chief]<br>
 come to a big dinner. I saw him in Creighton Sahib's office. I
saw<br>
 the two read the white stallion's pedigree. I heard the very
orders<br>
 given for the opening of a great war.'</p>

<p>'Hah!' Mahbub nodded with deepest eyes afire. 'The game is
well<br>
 played. That war is done now, and the evil, we hope, nipped
before<br>
 the flower- thanks to me - and thee. What didst thou later?'</p>

<p>'I made the news as it were a hook to catch me victual and
honour<br>
 among the villagers in a village whose priest drugged my lama.
But<br>
 I bore away the old man's purse, and the Brahmin found nothing.
So<br>
 next morning he was angry. Ho! Ho! And I also used the news when
I<br>
 fell into the hands of that white Regiment with their Bull!'</p>

<p>'That was foolishness.' Mahbub scowled. 'News is not meant to
be<br>
 thrown about like dung-cakes, but used sparingly - like
bhang.'</p>

<p>'So I think now, and moreover, it did me no sort of good. But
that<br>
 was very long ago,' he made as to brush it all away with a
thin<br>
 brown hand - 'and since then, and especially in the nights
under<br>
 the punkah at the madrissah, I have thought very greatly.'</p>

<p>'Is it permitted to ask whither the Heaven-born's thought
might<br>
 have led?' said Mahbub, with an elaborate sarcasm, smoothing
his<br>
 scarlet beard.</p>

<p>'It is permitted,' said Kim, and threw back the very tone.
'They<br>
 say at Nucklao that no Sahib must tell a black man that he has
made<br>
 a fault.'</p>

<p>Mahbub's hand shot into his bosom, for to call a Pathan a
'black<br>
 man' [kala admi] is a blood-insult. Then he remembered and
laughed.<br>
 'Speak, Sahib. Thy black man hears.'</p>

<p>'But,' said Kim, 'I am not a Sahib, and I say I made a fault
to<br>
 curse thee, Mahbub Ali, on that day at Umballa when I thought I
was<br>
 betrayed by a Pathan. I was senseless; for I was but newly
caught,<br>
 and I wished to kill that low-caste drummer-boy. I say now,
Hajji,<br>
 that it was well done; and I see my road all clear before me to
a<br>
 good service. I will stay in the madrissah till I am ripe.'</p>

<p>'Well said. Especially are distances and numbers and the
manner of<br>
 using compasses to be learned in that game. One waits in the
Hills<br>
 above to show thee.'</p>

<p>'I will learn their teaching upon a condition - that my time
is<br>
 given to me without question when the madrissah is shut. Ask
that<br>
 for me of the Colonel.'</p>

<p>'But why not ask the Colonel in the Sahibs' tongue?'</p>

<p>'The Colonel is the servant of the Government. He is sent
hither<br>
 and yon at a word, and must consider his own advancement. (See
how<br>
 much I have already learned at Nucklao!) Moreover, the Colonel
I<br>
 know since three months only. I have known one Mahbub Ali for
six<br>
 years. So! To the madrissah I will go. At the madrissah I
will<br>
 learn. In the madrissah I will be a Sahib. But when the
madrissah<br>
 is shut, then must I be free and go among my people. Otherwise
I<br>
 die!'</p>

<p>'And who are thy people, Friend of all the World?'</p>

<p>'This great and beautiful land,' said Kim, waving his paw
round the<br>
 little clay-walled room where the oil-lamp in its niche
burned<br>
 heavily through the tobacco-smoke. 'And, further, I would see
my<br>
 lama again. And, further, I need money.'</p>

<p>'That is the need of everyone,' said Mahbub ruefully. 'I will
give<br>
 thee eight annas, for much money is not picked out of
horses'<br>
 hooves, and it must suffice for many days. As to all the rest, I
am<br>
 well pleased, and no further talk is needed. Make haste to
learn,<br>
 and in three years, or it may be less, thou wilt be an aid -
even<br>
 to me.'</p>

<p>'Have I been such a hindrance till now?' said Kim, with a
boy's<br>
 giggle.</p>

<p>'Do not give answers,' Mahbub grunted. 'Thou art my new
horse-boy.<br>
 Go and bed among my men. They are near the north end of the<br>
 station, with the horses.'</p>

<p>'They will beat me to the south end of the station if I
come<br>
 without authority.'</p>

<p>Mahbub felt in his belt, wetted his thumb on a cake of Chinese
ink,<br>
 and dabbed the impression on a piece of soft native paper.
From<br>
 Balkh to Bombay men know that rough-ridged print with the old
scar<br>
 running diagonally across it.</p>

<p>'That is enough to show my headman. I come in the
morning.'</p>

<p>'By which road?' said Kim.</p>

<p>'By the road from the city. There is but one, and then we
return to<br>
 Creighton Sahib. I have saved thee a beating.'</p>

<p>'Allah! What is a beating when the very head is loose on
the<br>
 shoulders?'</p>

<p>Kim slid out quietly into the night, walked half round the
house,<br>
 keeping close to the walls, and headed away from the station for
a<br>
 mile or so. Then, fetching a wide compass, he worked back at<br>
 leisure, for he needed time to invent a story if any of
Mahbub's<br>
 retainers asked questions.</p>

<p>They were camped on a piece of waste ground beside the
railway,<br>
 and, being natives, had not, of course, unloaded the two trucks
in<br>
 which Mahbub's animals stood among a consignment of
country-breds<br>
 bought by the Bombay tram-company. The headman, a
broken-down,<br>
 consumptive-looking Mohammedan, promptly challenged Kim, but
was<br>
 pacified at sight of Mahbub's sign-manual.</p>

<p>'The Hajji has of his favour given me service,' said Kim
testily.<br>
 'If this be doubted, wait till he comes in the morning.
Meantime, a<br>
 place by the fire.'</p>

<p>Followed the usual aimless babble that every low-caste native
must<br>
 raise on every occasion. It died down, and Kim lay out behind
the<br>
 little knot of Mahbub's followers, almost under the wheels of
a<br>
 horse-truck, a borrowed blanket for covering. Now a bed
among<br>
 brickbats and ballast-refuse on a damp night, between
overcrowded<br>
 horses and unwashed Baltis, would not appeal to many white
boys;<br>
 but Kim was utterly happy. Change of scene, service, and<br>
 surroundings were the breath of his little nostrils, and
thinking<br>
 of the neat white cots of St Xavier's all arow under the
punkah<br>
 gave him joy as keen as the repetition of the
multiplication-table<br>
 in English.</p>

<p>'I am very old,' he thought sleepily. 'Every month I become a
year<br>
 more old. I was very young, and a fool to boot, when I took<br>
 Mahbub's message to Umballa. Even when I was with that white<br>
 Regiment I was very young and small and had no wisdom. But now
I<br>
 learn every day, and in three years the Colonel will take me out
of<br>
 the madrissah and let me go upon the Road with Mahbub hunting
for<br>
 horses' pedigrees, or maybe I shall go by myself; or maybe I
shall<br>
 find the lama and go with him. Yes; that is best. To walk again
as<br>
 a chela with my lama when he comes back to Benares.' The
thoughts<br>
 came more slowly and disconnectedly. He was plunging into a<br>
 beautiful dreamland when his ears caught a whisper, thin and
sharp,<br>
 above the monotonous babble round the fire. It came from behind
the<br>
 iron-skinned horse-truck.</p>

<p>'He is not here, then?'</p>

<p>'Where should he be but roystering in the city. Who looks for
a rat<br>
 in a frog-pond? Come away. He is not our man.'</p>

<p>'He must not go back beyond the Passes a second time. It is
the<br>
 order.'</p>

<p>'Hire some woman to drug him. It is a few rupees only, and
there is<br>
 no evidence.'</p>

<p>'Except the woman. It must be more certain; and remember the
price<br>
 upon his head.'</p>

<p>'Ay, but the police have a long arm, and we are far from
the<br>
 Border. If it were in Peshawur, now!'</p>

<p>'Yes - in Peshawur,' the second voice sneered. 'Peshawur, full
of<br>
 his blood-kin - full of bolt-holes and women behind whose
clothes<br>
 he will hide. Yes, Peshawur or Jehannum would suit us
equally<br>
 well.'</p>

<p>'Then what is the plan?'</p>

<p>'O fool, have I not told it a hundred times? Wait till he
comes to<br>
 lie down, and then one sure shot. The trucks are between us
and<br>
 pursuit. We have but to run back over the lines and go our
way.<br>
 They will not see whence the shot came. Wait here at least till
the<br>
 dawn. What manner of fakir art thou, to shiver at a little<br>
 watching?'</p>

<p>'Oho!' thought Kim, behind close-shut eyes. 'Once again it
is<br>
 Mahbub. Indeed a white stallion's pedigree is not a good thing
to<br>
 peddle to Sahibs! Or maybe Mahbub has been selling other news.
Now<br>
 what is to do, Kim? I know not where Mahbub houses, and if he
comes<br>
 here before the dawn they will shoot him. That would be no
profit<br>
 for thee, Kim. And this is not a matter for the police. That
would<br>
 be no profit for Mahbub; and' - he giggled almost aloud - 'I do
not<br>
 remember any lesson at Nucklao which will help me. Allah! Here
is<br>
 Kim and yonder are they. First, then, Kim must wake and go away,
so<br>
 that they shall not suspect. A bad dream wakes a man - thus
-,</p>

<p>He threw the blanket off his face, and raised himself suddenly
with<br>
 the terrible, bubbling, meaningless yell of the Asiatic roused
by<br>
 nightmare.</p>

<p>'Urr-urr-urr-urr! Ya-la-la-la-la! Narain! The churel! The
churel!'</p>

<p>A churel is the peculiarly malignant ghost of a woman who has
died<br>
 in child-bed. She haunts lonely roads, her feet are turned<br>
 backwards on the ankles, and she leads men to torment.</p>

<p>Louder rose Kim's quavering howl, till at last he leaped to
his<br>
 feet and staggered off sleepily, while the camp cursed him
for<br>
 waking them. Some twenty yards farther up the line he lay
down<br>
 again, taking care that the whisperers should hear his grunts
and<br>
 groans as he recomposed himself. After a few minutes he
rolled<br>
 towards the road and stole away into the thick darkness.</p>

<p>He paddled along swiftly till he came to a culvert, and
dropped<br>
 behind it, his chin on a level with the coping-stone. Here he
could<br>
 command all the night-traffic, himself unseen.</p>

<p>Two or three carts passed, jingling out to the suburbs; a
coughing<br>
 policeman and a hurrying foot-passenger or two who sang to keep
off<br>
 evil spirits. Then rapped the shod feet of a horse.</p>

<p>'Ah! This is more like Mahbub,' thought Kim, as the beast
shied at<br>
 the little head above the culvert.</p>

<p>'Ohe', Mahbub Ali,' he whispered, 'have a care!'</p>

<p>The horse was reined back almost on its haunches, and
forced<br>
 towards the culvert.</p>

<p>'Never again,' said Mahbub, 'will I take a shod horse for
night-<br>
 work. They pick up all the bones and nails in the city.' He
stooped<br>
 to lift its forefoot, and that brought his head within a foot
of<br>
 Kim's. Down - keep down,' he muttered. 'The night is full of<br>
 eyes.'</p>

<p>'Two men wait thy coming behind the horse-trucks. They will
shoot<br>
 thee at thy lying down, because there is a price on thy head.
I<br>
 heard, sleeping near the horses.'</p>

<p>'Didst thou see them? . .. Hold still, Sire of Devils!'
This<br>
 furiously to the horse.</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Was one dressed belike as a fakir?'</p>

<p>'One said to the other, "What manner of fakir art thou, to
shiver<br>
 at a little watching?"'</p>

<p>'Good. Go back to the camp and lie down. I do not die
tonight.'</p>

<p>Mahbub wheeled his horse and vanished. Kim tore back down the
ditch<br>
 till he reached a point opposite his second resting-place,
slipped<br>
 across the road like a weasel, and re-coiled himself in the<br>
 blanket.</p>

<p>'At least Mahbub knows,' he thought contentedly. 'And
certainly he<br>
 spoke as one expecting it. I do not think those two men will
profit<br>
 by tonight's watch.'</p>

<p>An hour passed, and, with the best will in the world to keep
awake<br>
 all night, he slept deeply. Now and again a night train
roared<br>
 along the metals within twenty feet of him; but he had all
the<br>
 Oriental's indifference to mere noise, and it did not even weave
a<br>
 dream through his slumber.</p>

<p>Mahbub was anything but asleep. It annoyed him vehemently
that<br>
 people outside his tribe and unaffected by his casual amours
should<br>
 pursue him for the life. His first and natural impulse was to
cross<br>
 the line lower down, work up again, and, catching his
well-wishers<br>
 from behind, summarily slay them. Here, he reflected with
sorrow,<br>
 another branch of the Government, totally unconnected with
Colonel<br>
 Creighton, might demand explanations which would be hard to
supply;<br>
 and he knew that south of the Border a perfectly ridiculous fuss
is<br>
 made about a corpse or so. He had not been troubled in this
way<br>
 since he sent Kim to Umballa with the message, and hoped
that<br>
 suspicion had been finally diverted.</p>

<p><br>
 Then a most brilliant notion struck him.</p>

<p>'The English do eternally tell the truth,' he said, 'therefore
we<br>
 of this country are eternally made foolish. By Allah, I will
tell<br>
 the truth to an Englishman! Of what use is the Government police
if<br>
 a poor Kabuli be robbed of his horses in their very trucks. This
is<br>
 as bad as Peshawur! I should lay a complaint at the station.
Better<br>
 still, some young Sahib on the Railway! They are zealous, and
if<br>
 they catch thieves it is remembered to their honour.'</p>

<p>He tied up his horse outside the station, and strode on to
the<br>
 platform.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Mahbub Ali' said a young Assistant District
Traffic<br>
 Superintendent who was waiting to go down the line - a tall,
tow-<br>
 haired, horsey youth in dingy white linen. 'What are you
doing<br>
 here? Selling weeds - eh?'</p>

<p>'No; I am not troubled for my horses. I come to look for
Lutuf<br>
 Ullah. I have a truck-load up the line. Could anyone take them
out<br>
 without the Railway's knowledge?'</p>

<p>'Shouldn't think so, Mahbub. You can claim against us if they
do.'</p>

<p>'I have seen two men crouching under the wheels of one of
the<br>
 trucks nearly all night. Fakirs do not steal horses, so I gave
them<br>
 no more thought. I would find Lutuf Ullah, my partner.'</p>

<p>'The deuce you did? And you didn't bother your head about it?
'Pon<br>
 my word, it's just almost as well that I met you. What were
they<br>
 like, eh?'</p>

<p>'They were only fakirs. They will no more than take a little
grain,<br>
 perhaps, from one of the trucks. There are many up the line.
The<br>
 State will never miss the dole. I came here seeking for my
partner,<br>
 Lutuf Ullah</p>

<p>'Never mind your partner. Where are your horse-trucks?'</p>

<p>'A little to this side of the farthest place where they make
lamps<br>
 for the trains.'</p>

<p>'The signal-box! Yes.'</p>

<p>'And upon the rail nearest to the road upon the right-hand
side -<br>
 looking up the line thus. But as regards Lutuf Ullah - a tall
man<br>
 with a broken nose, and a Persian greyhound Aie!'</p>

<p>The boy had hurried off to wake up a young and
enthusiastic<br>
 policeman; for, as he said, the Railway had suffered much
from<br>
 depredations in the goods-yard. Mahbub Ali chuckled in his
dyed<br>
 beard.</p>

<p>'They will walk in their boots, making a noise, and then they
will<br>
 wonder why there are no fakirs. They are very clever
boys--Barton<br>
 Sahib and Young Sahib.'</p>

<p>He waited idly for a few minutes, expecting to see them hurry
up<br>
 the line girt for action. A light engine slid through the
station,<br>
 and he caught a glimpse of young.Barton in the cab.</p>

<p>'I did that child an injustice. He is not altogether a fool,'
said<br>
 Mahbub Ali. 'To take a fire-carriage for a thief is a new
game!'</p>

<p>When Mahbub Ali came to his camp in the dawn, no one thought
it<br>
 worth while to tell him any news of the night. No one, at
least,<br>
 but one small horseboy, newly advanced to the great man's
service,<br>
 whom Mahbub called to his tiny tent to assist in some
packing.</p>

<p>'It is all known to me,' whispered Kim, bending above
saddlebags.<br>
 'Two Sahibs came up on a te-train. I was running to and fro in
the<br>
 dark on this side of the trucks as the te-train moved up and
down<br>
 slowly. They fell upon two men sitting under this truck -
Hajji,<br>
 what shall I do with this lump of tobacco? Wrap it in paper and
put<br>
 it under the salt-bag? Yes - and struck them down. But one
man<br>
 struck at a Sahib with a fakir's buck's horn' (Kim meant the<br>
 conjoined black-buck horns, which are a fakir's sole
temporal<br>
 weapon) - 'the blood came. So the other Sahib, first smiting
his<br>
 own man senseless, smote the stabber with a short gun which
had<br>
 rolled from the first man's hand. They all raged as though
mad<br>
 together.'</p>

<p>Mahbub smiled with heavenly resignation. 'No! That is not so
much<br>
 dewanee [madness, or a case for the civil court - the word can
be<br>
 punned upon both ways] as nizamut [a criminal case]. A gun,
sayest<br>
 thou? Ten good years in jail.'</p>

<p>'Then they both lay still, but I think they were nearly dead
when<br>
 they were put on the te-train. Their heads moved thus. And there
is<br>
 much blood on the line. Come and see?'</p>

<p>'I have seen blood before. Jail is the sure place - and
assuredly<br>
 they will give false names, and assuredly no man will find them
for<br>
 a long time. They were unfriends of mine. Thy fate and mine seem
on<br>
 one string. What a tale for the healer of pearls! Now swiftly
with<br>
 the saddle-bags and the cooking-platter. We will take out
the<br>
 horses and away to Simla.'</p>

<p>Swiftly - as Orientals understand speed - with long
explanations,<br>
 with abuse and windy talk, carelessly, amid a hundred checks
for<br>
 little things forgotten, the untidy camp broke up and led the
half-<br>
 dozen stiff and fretful horses along the Kalka road in the fresh
of<br>
 the rain-swept dawn. Kim, regarded as Mahbub Ali's favourite by
all<br>
 who wished to stand well with the Pathan, was not called upon
to<br>
 work. They strolled on by the easiest of stages, halting every
few<br>
 hours at a wayside shelter. Very many Sahibs travel along the
Kalka<br>
 road; and, as Mahbub Ali says, every young Sahib must needs
esteem<br>
 himself a judge of a horse, and, though he be over head in debt
to<br>
 the money-lender, must make as if to buy. That was the reason
that<br>
 Sahib after Sahib, rolling along in a stage-carriage, would
stop<br>
 and open talk. Some would even descend from their vehicles and
feel<br>
 the horses' legs; asking inane questions, or, through sheer<br>
 ignorance of the vernacular, grossly insulting the
imperturbable<br>
 trader.</p>

<p>'When first I dealt with Sahibs, and that was when Colonel
Soady<br>
 Sahib was Governor of Fort Abazai and flooded the
Commissioner's<br>
 camping-ground for spite,' Mahbub confided to Kim as the boy
filled<br>
 his pipe under a tree, 'I did not know how greatly they were
fools,<br>
 and this made me wroth. As thus -, and he told Kim a tale of
an<br>
 expression, misused in all innocence, that doubled Kim up
with<br>
 mirth. 'Now I see, however,' - he exhaled smoke slowly - 'that
it<br>
 is with them as with all men - in certain matters they are
wise,<br>
 and in others most foolish. Very foolish it is to use the
wrong<br>
 word to a stranger; for though the heart may be clean of
offence,<br>
 how is the stranger to know that? He is more like to search
truth<br>
 with a dagger.'</p>

<p>'True. True talk,' said Kim solemnly. 'Fools speak of a cat
when a<br>
 woman is brought to bed, for instance. I have heard them.'</p>

<p>'Therefore, in one situate as thou art, it particularly
behoves<br>
 thee to remember this with both kinds of faces. Among Sahibs,
never<br>
 forgetting thou art a Sahib; among the folk of Hind, always<br>
 remembering thou art -' He paused, with a puzzled smile.</p>

<p>'What am I? Mussalman, Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist? That is a
hard<br>
 knot.'</p>

<p>'Thou art beyond question an unbeliever, and therefore thou
wilt be<br>
 damned. So says my Law - or I think it does. But thou art also
my<br>
 Little Friend of all the World, and I love thee. So says my
heart.<br>
 This matter of creeds is like horseflesh. The wise man knows
horses<br>
 are good - that there is a profit to be made from all; and
for<br>
 myself- but that I am a good Sunni and hate the men of Tirah -
I<br>
 could believe the same of all the Faiths. Now manifestly a<br>
 Kathiawar mare taken from the sands of her birthplace and
removed<br>
 to the west of Bengal founders - nor is even a Balkh stallion
(and<br>
 there are no better horses than those of Balkh, were they not
so<br>
 heavy in the shoulder) of any account in the great Northern
deserts<br>
 beside the snow-camels I have seen. Therefore I say in my heart
the<br>
 Faiths are like the horses. Each has merit in its own
country.'</p>

<p>'But my lama said altogether a different thing.'</p>

<p>'Oh, he is an old dreamer of dreams from Bhotiyal. My heart is
a<br>
 little angry, Friend of all the World, that thou shouldst see
such<br>
 worth in a man so little known.'</p>

<p>'It is true, Hajji; but that worth do I see, and to him my
heart is<br>
 drawn.'</p>

<p>'And his to thine, I hear. Hearts are like horses. They come
and<br>
 they go against bit or spur. Shout Gul Sher Khan yonder to drive
in<br>
 that bay stallion's pickets more firmly. We do not want a
horse-<br>
 fight at every resting-stage, and the dun and the black will
be<br>
 locked in a little . . . Now hear me. Is it necessary to the<br>
 comfort of thy heart to see that lama?'</p>

<p>'It is one part of my bond,' said Kim. 'If I do not see him,
and if<br>
 he is taken from me, I will go out of that madrissah in
Nucklao<br>
 and, and - once gone, who is to find me again?'</p>

<p>'It is true. Never was colt held on a lighter heel-rope than
thou.'<br>
 Mahbub nodded his head.</p>

<p>'Do not be afraid.' Kim spoke as though he could have
evanished on<br>
 the moment. 'My lama has said that he will come to see me at
the<br>
 madrissah -,</p>

<p>'A beggar and his bowl in the presence of those young Sa
-'</p>

<p>'Not all!' Kim cut in with a snort. 'Their eyes are blued and
their<br>
 nails are blackened with low-caste blood, many of them. Sons
of<br>
 mehteranees - brothers-in-law to the bhungi [sweeper].'</p>

<p>We need not follow the rest of the pedigree; but Kim made
his<br>
 little point clearly and without heat, chewing a piece of
sugar-<br>
 cane the while.</p>

<p>'Friend of all the World,' said Mahbub, pushing over the pipe
for<br>
 the boy to clean, 'I have met many men, women, and boys, and not
a<br>
 few Sahibs. I have never in all my days met such an imp as
thou<br>
 art.'</p>

<p>'And why? When I always tell thee the truth.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps the very reason, for this is a world of danger to
honest<br>
 men.' Mahbub Ali hauled himself off the ground, girt in his
belt,<br>
 and went over to the horses.</p>

<p>'Or sell it?'</p>

<p>There was that in the tone that made Mahbub halt and turn.
'What<br>
 new devilry?'</p>

<p>'Eight annas, and I will tell,' said Kim, grinning. 'It
touches thy<br>
 peace.'</p>

<p>'O Shaitan!' Mahbub gave the money.</p>

<p>'Rememberest thou the little business of the thieves in the
dark,<br>
 down yonder at Umballa?'</p>

<p>'Seeing they sought my life, I have not altogether forgotten.
Why?'</p>

<p>'Rememberest thou the Kashmir Serai?'</p>

<p>'I will twist thy ears in a moment - Sahib.'</p>

<p>'No need - Pathan. Only, the second fakir, whom the Sahibs
beat<br>
 senseless, was the man who came to search thy bulkhead at
Lahore. I<br>
 saw his face as they helped him on the engine. The very same
man.'</p>

<p>'Why didst thou not tell before?'</p>

<p>'Oh, he will go to jail, and be safe for some years. There is
no<br>
 need to tell more than is necessary at any one time. Besides, I
did<br>
 not then need money for sweetmeats.'</p>

<p>'Allah kerim!' said Mahbub Ah. 'Wilt thou some day sell my
head for<br>
 a few sweetmeats if the fit takes thee?'</p>

<p>Kim will remember till he dies that long, lazy journey
from<br>
 Umballa, through Kalka and the Pinjore Gardens near by, up
to<br>
 Simla. A sudden spate in the Gugger River swept down one
horse<br>
 (the most valuable, be sure), and nearly drowned Kim among
the<br>
 dancing boulders. Farther up the road the horses were stampeded
by<br>
 a Government elephant, and being in high condition of grass
food,<br>
 it cost a day and a half to get them together again. Then they
met<br>
 Sikandar Khan coming down with a few unsaleable screws -
remnants<br>
 of his string -and Mahbub, who has more of horse-coping in
his<br>
 little fingernail than Sikandar Khan in all his tents, must
needs<br>
 buy two of the worst, and that meant eight hours' laborious<br>
 diplomacy and untold tobacco. But it was all pure delight -
the<br>
 wandering road, climbing, dipping, and sweeping about the
growing<br>
 spurs; the flush of the morning laid along the distant snows;
the<br>
 branched cacti, tier upon tier on the stony hillsides; the
voices<br>
 of a thousand water-channels; the chatter of the monkeys;
the<br>
 solemn deodars, climbing one after another with down-drooped<br>
 branches; the vista of the Plains rolled out far beneath them;
the<br>
 incessant twanging of the tonga-horns and the wild rush of the
led<br>
 horses when a tonga swung round a curve; the halts for
prayers<br>
 (Mahbub was very religious in dry-washings and bellowings when
time<br>
 did not press); the evening conferences by the halting-places,
when<br>
 camels and bullocks chewed solemnly together and the stolid
drivers<br>
 told the news of the Road - all these things lifted Kim's heart
to<br>
 song within him.</p>

<p>'But, when the singing and dancing is done,' said Mahbub
Ali,<br>
 'comes the Colonel Sahib's, and that is not so sweet.'</p>

<p>'A fair land - a most beautiful land is this of Hind - and the
land<br>
 of the Five Rivers is fairer than all,' Kim half chanted. 'Into
it<br>
 I will go again if Mahbub Ali or the Colonel lift hand or
foot<br>
 against me. Once gone, who shall find me? Look, Hajji, is
yonder<br>
 the city of Simla? Allah, what a city!'</p>

<p>'My father's brother, and he was an old man when Mackerson
Sahib's<br>
 well was new at Peshawur, could recall when there were but
two<br>
 houses in it.</p>

<p>He led the horses below the main road into the lower Simla
bazar -<br>
 the crowded rabbit-warren that climbs up from the valley to
the<br>
 Town Hall at an angle of forty-five. A man who knows his way
there<br>
 can defy all the police of India's summer capital, so
cunningly<br>
 does veranda communicate with veranda, alley-way with
alley-way,<br>
 and bolt-hole with bolt-hole. Here live those who minister to
the<br>
 wants of the glad city - jhampanis who pull the pretty
ladies'<br>
 'rickshaws by night and gamble till the dawn; grocers,
oil-sellers,<br>
 curio-vendors, firewood-dealers, priests, pickpockets, and
native<br>
 employees of the Government. Here are discussed by courtesans
the<br>
 things which are supposed to be profoundest secrets of the
India<br>
 Council; and here gather all the sub-sub-agents of half the
Native<br>
 States. Here, too, Mahbub Ali rented a room, much more
securely<br>
 locked than his bulkhead at Lahore, in the house of a
Mohammedan<br>
 cattle-dealer. It was a place of miracles, too, for there went
in<br>
 at twilight a Mohammedan horseboy, and there came out an hour
later<br>
 a Eurasian lad - the Lucknow girl's dye was of the best - in
badly-<br>
 fitting shop-clothes.</p>

<p>'I have spoken with Creighton Sahib,' quoth Mahbub Ali, and
a<br>
 second time has the Hand of Friendship averted the Whip of<br>
 Calamity. He says that thou hast altogether wasted sixty days
upon<br>
 the Road, and it is too late, therefore, to send thee to any
Hill-<br>
 school.'</p>

<p>'I have said that my holidays are my own. I do not go to
school<br>
 twice over. That is one part of my bond.'</p>

<p>'The Colonel Sahib is not yet aware of that contract. Thou art
to<br>
 lodge in Lurgan Sahib's house till it is time to go again to<br>
 Nucklao.'</p>

<p>'I had sooner lodge with thee, Mahbub.'</p>

<p>'Thou dost not know the honour. Lurgan Sahib himself asked
for<br>
 thee. Thou wilt go up the hill and along the road atop, and
there<br>
 thou must forget for a while that thou hast ever seen or spoken
to<br>
 me, Mahbub Ali, who sells horses to Creighton Sahib, whom thou
dost<br>
 not know. Remember this order.'</p>

<p>Kim nodded. 'Good,' said he, 'and who is Lurgan Sahib? Nay' -
he<br>
 caught Mahbub's sword-keen glance - 'indeed I have never heard
his<br>
 name. Is he by chance - he lowered his voice -'one of us?'</p>

<p>'What talk is this of us, Sahib?' Mahbub Ali returned, in the
tone<br>
 he used towards Europeans. 'I am a Pathan; thou art a Sahib and
the<br>
 son of a Sahib. Lurgan Sahib has a shop among the European
shops.<br>
 All Simla knows it. Ask there ... and, Friend of all the World,
he<br>
 is one to be obeyed to the last wink of his eyelashes. Men say
he<br>
 does magic, but that should not touch thee. Go up the hill and
ask.<br>
 Here begins the Great Game.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><br>
 S' doaks was son of Yelth the wise -<br>
 Chief of the Raven clan.<br>
 Itswoot the Bear had him in care<br>
 To make him a medicine-man.</p>

<p>He was quick and quicker to learn -<br>
 Bold and bolder to dare:<br>
 He danced the dread Kloo-Kwallie Dance<br>
 To tickle Itswoot the Bear!</p>

<p>Oregon Legend</p>

<p>Kim flung himself whole-heartedly upon the next turn of the
wheel.<br>
 He would be a Sahib again for a while. In that idea, so soon as
he<br>
 had reached the broad road under Simla Town Hall, he cast about
for<br>
 one to impress. A Hindu child, some ten years old, squatted
under a<br>
 lamp-post.</p>

<p>Where is Mr Lurgan's house?' demanded Kim.</p>

<p><br>
 'I do not understand English,' was the answer, and Kim shifted
his<br>
 speech accordingly.</p>

<p>'I will show.'</p>

<p>Together they set off through the mysterious dusk, full of
the<br>
 noises of a city below the hillside, and the breath of a cool
wind<br>
 in deodar-crowned Jakko, shouldering the stars. The
house-lights,<br>
 scattered on every level, made, as it were, a double
firmament.<br>
 Some were fixed, others belonged to the 'rickshaws of the
careless,<br>
 open-spoken English folk, going out to dinner.</p>

<p>'It is here,' said Kim's guide, and halted in a veranda flush
with<br>
 the main road. No door stayed them, but a curtain of beaded
reeds<br>
 that split up the lamplight beyond.</p>

<p>'He is come,' said the boy, in a voice little louder than a
sigh,<br>
 and vanished. Kim felt sure that the boy had been posted to
guide<br>
 him from the first, but, putting a bold face on it, parted
the<br>
 curtain. A black-bearded man, with a green shade over his eyes,
sat<br>
 at a table, and, one by one, with short, white hands, picked
up<br>
 globules of light from a tray before him, threaded them on a<br>
 glancing silken string, and hummed to himself the while. Kim
was<br>
 conscious that beyond the circle of light the room was full
of<br>
 things that smelt like all the temples of all the East. A whiff
of<br>
 musk, a puff of sandal-wood, and a breath of sickly
jessamine-oil<br>
 caught his opened nostrils.</p>

<p>'I am here,' said Kim at last, speaking in the vernacular:
the<br>
 smells made him forget that he was to be a Sahib</p>

<p>'Seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one,' the man counted to
himself,<br>
 stringing pearl after pearl so quickly that Kim could
scarcely<br>
 follow his fingers. He slid off the green shade and looked
fixedly<br>
 at Kim for a full half-minute. The pupils of the eye dilated
and<br>
 closed to pin-pricks, as if at will. There was a fakir by
the<br>
 Taksali Gate who had just this gift and made money by it,<br>
 especially when cursing silly women. Kim stared with interest.
His<br>
 disreputable friend could further twitch his ears, almost like
a<br>
 goat, and Kim was disappointed that this new man could not
imitate<br>
 him.</p>

<p>'Do not be afraid,' said Lurgan Sahib suddenly.</p>

<p>'Why should I fear?'</p>

<p>'Thou wilt sleep here tonight, and stay with me till it is
time to<br>
 go again to Nucklao. It is an order.'</p>

<p>'It is an order,' Kim repeated. 'But where shall I sleep?'</p>

<p>'Here, in this room.' Lurgan Sahib waved his hand towards
the<br>
 darkness behind him.</p>

<p>'So be it,' said Kim composedly. 'Now?'</p>

<p>He nodded and held the lamp above his head. As the light
swept<br>
 them, there leaped out from the walls a collection of
Tibetan<br>
 devil-dance masks, hanging above the fiend-embroidered draperies
of<br>
 those ghastly functions - horned masks, scowling masks, and
masks<br>
 of idiotic terror. In a corner, a Japanese warrior, mailed
and<br>
 plumed, menaced him with a halberd, and a score of lances
and<br>
 khandas and kuttars gave back the unsteady gleam. But what<br>
 interested Kim more than all these things - he had seen
devil-dance<br>
 masks at the Lahore Museum - was a glimpse of the soft-eyed
Hindu<br>
 child who had left him in the doorway, sitting cross-legged
under<br>
 the table of pearls with a little smile on his scarlet lips.</p>

<p>'I think that Lurgan Sahib wishes to make me afraid. And I am
sure<br>
 that that devil's brat below the table wishes to see me
afraid.<br>
 This place,' he said aloud, 'is like a Wonder House. Where is
my<br>
 bed?'</p>

<p>Lurgan Sahib pointed to a native quilt in a corner by the
loathsome<br>
 masks, picked up the lamp, and left the room black.</p>

<p>'Was that Lurgan Sahib?' Kim asked as he cuddled down. No
answer.<br>
 He could hear the Hindu boy breathing, however, and, guided by
the<br>
 sound, crawled across the floor, and cuffed into the
darkness,<br>
 crying: 'Give answer, devil! Is this the way to lie to a
Sahib?'</p>

<p>&gt;From the darkness he fancied he could hear the echo of a
chuckle.<br>
 It could not be his soft-fleshed companion, because he was
weeping.<br>
 So Kim lifted up his voice and called aloud:</p>

<p>'Lurgan Sahib! O Lurgan Sahib! Is it an order that thy servant
does<br>
 not speak to me?'</p>

<p>'It is an order.' The voice came from behind him and he
started.</p>

<p>'Very good. But remember,' he muttered, as he resought the
quilt,<br>
 'I will beat thee in the morning. I do not love Hindus.'</p>

<p><br>
 That was no cheerful night; the room being overfull of voices
and<br>
 music. Kim was waked twice by someone calling his name. The
second<br>
 time he set out in search, and ended by bruising his nose
against a<br>
 box that certainly spoke with a human tongue, but in no sort
of<br>
 human accent. It seemed to end in a tin trumpet and to be joined
by<br>
 wires to a smaller box on the floor - so far, at least, as he
could<br>
 judge by touch. And the voice, very hard and whirring, came out
of<br>
 the trumpet. Kim rubbed his nose and grew furious, thinking,
as<br>
 usual, in Hindi.</p>

<p>'This with a beggar from the bazar might be good, but - I am
a<br>
 Sahib and the son of a Sahib and, whichis twice as much more<br>
 beside, a student of Nucklao. Yess' (here he turned to
English),<br>
 'a boy of St Xavier's. Damn Mr Lurgan's eyes! - It is some sort
of<br>
 machinery like a sewing-machine. Oh, it is a great cheek of him
-<br>
 we are not frightened that way at Lucknow - No!' Then in
Hindi:<br>
 'But what does he gain? He is only a trader - I am in his<br>
 shop. But Creighton Sahib is a Colonel - and I think
Creighton<br>
 Sahib gave orders that it should be done. How I will beat
that<br>
 Hindu in the morning! What is this?'</p>

<p>The trumpet-box was pouring out a string of the most
elaborate<br>
 abuse that even Kim had ever heard, in a high uninterested
voice,<br>
 that for a moment lifted the short hairs of his neck. When the
vile<br>
 thing drew breath, Kim was reassured by the soft,
sewing-machine-<br>
 like whirr.</p>

<p>'Chup! [Be still)' he cried, and again he heard a chuckle
that<br>
 decided him. 'Chup - or I break your head.'</p>

<p>The box took no heed. Kim wrenched at the tin trumpet and
something<br>
 lifted with a click. He had evidently raised a lid. If there
were a<br>
 devil inside, now was its time, for - he sniffed -thus did
the<br>
 sewing-machines of the bazar smell. He would clean that shaitan.
He<br>
 slipped off his jacket, and plunged it into the box's mouth.<br>
 Something long and round bent under the pressure, there was a
whirr<br>
 and the voice stopped - as voices must if you ram a
thrice-doubled<br>
 coat on to the wax cylinder and into the works of an
expensive<br>
 phonograph. Kim finished his slumbers with a serene mind.</p>

<p>In the morning he was aware of Lurgan Sahib looking down on
him.</p>

<p>'Oah!' said Kim, firmly resolved to cling to his Sahib-dom.
'There<br>
 was a box in the night that gave me bad talk. So I stopped it.
Was<br>
 it your box?'</p>

<p>The man held out his hand.</p>

<p>'Shake hands, O'Hara,' he said. 'Yes, it was my box. I keep
such<br>
 things because my friends the Rajahs like them. That one is
broken,<br>
 but it was cheap at the price. Yes, my friends, the Kings, are
very<br>
 fond of toys - and so am I sometimes.'</p>

<p>Kim looked him over out of the corners of his eyes. He was a
Sahib<br>
 in that he wore Sahib's clothes; the accent of his Urdu, the<br>
 intonation of his English, showed that he was anything but a
Sahib.<br>
 He seemed to understand what moved in Kim's mind ere the boy
opened<br>
 his mouth, and he took no pains to explain himself as did
Father<br>
 Victor or the Lucknow masters. Sweetest of all - he treated Kim
as<br>
 an equal on the Asiatic side.</p>

<p>'I am sorry you cannot beat my boy this morning. He says he
will<br>
 kill you with a knife or poison. He is jealous, so I have put
him<br>
 in the corner and I shall not speak to him today. He has just
tried<br>
 to kill me. You must help me with the breakfast. He is almost
too<br>
 jealous to trust, just now.'</p>

<p>Now a genuine imported Sahib from England would have made a
great<br>
 to-do over this tale. Lurgan Sahib stated it as simply as
Mahbub<br>
 Ali was used to record his little affairs in the North.</p>

<p>The back veranda of the shop was built out over the sheer
hillside,<br>
 and they looked down into their neighbours' chimney-pots, as is
the<br>
 custom of Simla. But even more than the purely Persian meal
cooked<br>
 by Lurgan Sahib with his own hands, the shop fascinated Kim.
The<br>
 Lahore Museum was larger, but here were more wonders -
ghost-<br>
 daggers and prayer-wheels from Tibet; turquoise and raw
amber<br>
 necklaces; green jade bangles; curiously packed incense-sticks
in<br>
 jars crusted over with raw garnets; the devil-masks of
overnight<br>
 and a wall full of peacock-blue draperies; gilt figures of
Buddha,<br>
 and little portable lacquer altars; Russian samovars with<br>
 turquoises on the lid; egg-shell china sets in quaint
octagonal<br>
 cane boxes; yellow ivory crucifixes - from Japan of all places
in<br>
 the world, so Lurgan Sahib said; carpets in dusty bales,
smelling<br>
 atrociously, pushed back behind torn and rotten screens of<br>
 geometrical work; Persian water-jugs for the hands after
meals;<br>
 dull copper incense-burners neither Chinese nor Persian,
with<br>
 friezes of fantastic devils running round them; tarnished
silver<br>
 belts that knotted like raw hide; hairpins of jade, ivory,
and<br>
 plasma; arms of all sorts and kinds, and a thousand other
oddments<br>
 were cased, or piled, or merely thrown into the room, leaving
a<br>
 clear space only round the rickety deal table, where Lurgan
Sahib<br>
 worked.</p>

<p>'Those things are nothing,' said his host, following Kim's
glance.<br>
 'I buy them because they are pretty, and sometimes I sell - if
I<br>
 like the buyer's look. My work is on the table - some of
it.'</p>

<p>It blazed in the morning light - all red and blue and
green<br>
 flashes, picked out with the vicious blue-white spurt of a
diamond<br>
 here and there. Kim opened his eyes.</p>

<p>'Oh, they are quite well, those stones. It will not hurt them
to<br>
 take the sun. Besides, they are cheap. But with sick stones it
is<br>
 very different.' He piled Kim's plate anew. 'There is no one but
me<br>
 can doctor a sick pearl and re-blue turquoises. I grant you
opals -<br>
 any fool can cure an opal - but for a sick pearl there is only
me.<br>
 Suppose I were to die! Then there would be no one ... Oh no!
You<br>
 cannot do anything with jewels. It will be quite enough if
you<br>
 understand a little about the Turquoise - some day.'</p>

<p>He moved to the end of the veranda to refill the heavy, porous
clay<br>
 water-jug from the filter.</p>

<p>'Do you want drink?'</p>

<p>Kim nodded. Lurgan Sahib, fifteen feet off, laid one hand on
the<br>
 jar. Next instant, it stood at Kim's elbow, full to within half
an<br>
 inch of the brim - the white cloth only showing, by a small<br>
 wrinkle, where it had slid into place.</p>

<p>'Wah!' said Kim in most utter amazement. 'That is magic.'
Lurgan<br>
 Sahib's smile showed that the compliment had gone home.</p>

<p>'Throw it back.'</p>

<p>'It will break.'</p>

<p>'I say, throw it back.'</p>

<p>Kim pitched it at random. It fell short and crashed into
fifty<br>
 pieces, while the water dripped through the rough veranda
boarding.</p>

<p>'I said it would break.'</p>

<p>'All one. Look at it. Look at the largest piece.'</p>

<p>That lay with a sparkle of water in its curve, as it were a
star on<br>
 the floor. Kim looked intently. Lurgan Sahib laid one hand
gently<br>
 on the nape of his neck, stroked it twice or thrice, and
whispered:<br>
 'Look! It shall come to life again, piece by piece. First the
big<br>
 piece shall join itself to two others on the right and the left
-<br>
 on the right and the left. Look!'</p>

<p>To save his life, Kim could not have turned his head. The
light<br>
 touch held him as in a vice, and his blood tingled
pleasantly<br>
 through him. There was one large piece of the jar where there
had<br>
 been three, and above them the shadowy outline of the entire<br>
 vessel. He could see the veranda through it, but it was
thickening<br>
 and darkening with each beat of his pulse. Yet the jar - how
slowly<br>
 the thoughts came! - the jar had been smashed before his
eyes.<br>
 Another wave of prickling fire raced down his neck, as Lurgan
Sahib<br>
 moved his hand.</p>

<p>'Look! It is coming into shape,' said Lurgan Sahib.</p>

<p>So far Kim had been thinking in Hindi, but a tremor came on
him,<br>
 and with an effort like that of a swimmer before sharks, who
hurls<br>
 himself half out of the water, his mind leaped up from a
darkness<br>
 that was swallowing it and took refuge in - the
multiplication-<br>
 table in English!</p>

<p>'Look! It is coming into shape,' whispered Lurgan Sahib.</p>

<p>The jar had been smashed - yess, smashed - not the native
word, he<br>
 would not think of that - but smashed - into fifty pieces,
and<br>
 twice three was six, and thrice three was nine, and four
times<br>
 three was twelve. He clung desperately to the repetition.
The<br>
 shadow-outline of the jar cleared like a mist after rubbing
eyes.<br>
 There were the broken shards; there was the spilt water drying
in<br>
 the sun, and through the cracks of the veranda showed, all
ribbed,<br>
 the white house-wall below - and thrice twelve was
thirty-six!</p>

<p>'Look! Is it coming into shape?' asked Lurgan Sahib.</p>

<p>'But it is smashed - smashed,' he gasped - Lurgan Sahib had
been<br>
 muttering softly for the last half-minute. Kim wrenched his
head<br>
 aside. 'Look! Dekho! It is there as it was there.'</p>

<p>'It is there as it was there,' said Lurgan, watching Kim
closely<br>
 while the boy rubbed his neck. 'But you are the first of many
who<br>
 has ever seen it so.' He wiped his broad forehead.</p>

<p>'Was that more magic?' Kim asked suspiciously. The tingle had
gone<br>
 from his veins; he felt unusually wide awake.</p>

<p>'No, that was not magic. It was only to see if there was - a
flaw<br>
 in a jewel. Sometimes very fine jewels will fly all to pieces if
a<br>
 man holds them in his hand, and knows the proper way. That is
why<br>
 one must be careful before one sets them. Tell me, did you see
the<br>
 shape of the pot?'</p>

<p>'For a little time. It began to grow like a flower from
the<br>
 ground.'</p>

<p>'And then what did you do? I mean, how did you think?'</p>

<p>'Oah! I knew it was broken, and so, I think, that was what
I<br>
 thought - and it was broken.'</p>

<p>'Hm! Has anyone ever done that same sort of magic to you
before?'</p>

<p>'If it was,' said Kim 'do you think I should let it again? I
should<br>
 run away.'</p>

<p>'And now you are not afraid - eh?'</p>

<p>'Not now.'</p>

<p>Lurgan Sahib looked at him more closely than ever. 'I shall
ask<br>
 Mahbub Ali - not now, but some day later,' he muttered. 'I
am<br>
 pleased with you - yes; and I am pleased with you - no. You are
the<br>
 first that ever saved himself. I wish I knew what it was that
...<br>
 But you are right. You should not tell that - not even to
me.'</p>

<p>He turned into the dusky gloom of the shop, and sat down at
the<br>
 table, rubbing his hands softly. A small, husky sob came
from<br>
 behind a pile of carpets. It was the Hindu child obediently
facing<br>
 towards the wall. His thin shoulders worked with grief.</p>

<p>'Ah! He is jealous, so jealous. I wonder if he will try to
poison<br>
 me again in my breakfast, and make me cook it twice.</p>

<p>'Kubbee - kubbee nahin [Never - never. No!]', came the
broken<br>
 answer.</p>

<p>'And whether he will kill this other boy?'</p>

<p><br>
 'Kubbee - kubbee nahin.'</p>

<p>'What do you think he will do?' He turned suddenly on Kim.</p>

<p>'Oah! I do not know. Let him go, perhaps. Why did he want to
poison<br>
 you?'</p>

<p>'Because he is so fond of me. Suppose you were fond of
someone, and<br>
 you saw someone come, and the man you were fond of was more
pleased<br>
 with him than he was with you, what would you do?'</p>

<p>Kim thought. Lurgan repeated the sentence slowly in the
vernacular.<br>
 'I should not poison that man,' said Kim reflectively, 'but
I<br>
 should beat that boy - if that boy was fond of my man. But
first, I<br>
 would ask that boy if it were true.'</p>

<p>'Ah! He thinks everyone must be fond of me.'</p>

<p>'Then I think he is a fool.'</p>

<p>'Hearest thou?' said Lurgan Sahib to the shaking shoulders.
'The<br>
 Sahib's son thinks thou art a little fool. Come out, and next
time<br>
 thy heart is troubled, do not try white arsenic quite so
openly.<br>
 Surely the Devil Dasim was lord of our table-cloth that day!
It<br>
 might have made me ill, child, and then a stranger would
have<br>
 guarded the jewels. Come!'</p>

<p>The child, heavy-eyed with much weeping, crept out from behind
the<br>
 bale and flung himself passionately at Lurgan Sahib's feet, with
an<br>
 extravagance of remorse that impressed even Kim.</p>

<p>'I will look into the ink-pools - I will faithfully guard
the<br>
 jewels! Oh, my Father and my Mother, send him away!' He
indicated<br>
 Kim with a backward jerk of his bare heel.</p>

<p>'Not yet - not yet. In a little while he will go away again.
But<br>
 now he is at school - at a new madrissah - and thou shalt be
his<br>
 teacher. Play the Play of the Jewels against him. I will
keep<br>
 tally.'</p>

<p>The child dried his tears at once, and dashed to the back of
the<br>
 shop, whence he returned with a copper tray.</p>

<p>'Give me!' he said to Lurgan Sahib. 'Let them come from thy
hand,<br>
 for he may say that I knew them before.'</p>

<p>'Gently - gently,' the man replied, and from a drawer under
the<br>
 table dealt a half-handful of clattering trifles into the
tray.</p>

<p>'Now,' said the child, waving an old newspaper. 'Look on them
as<br>
 long as thou wilt, stranger. Count and, if need be, handle.
One<br>
 look is enough for me.' He turned his back proudly.</p>

<p>'But what is the game?'</p>

<p>'When thou hast counted and handled and art sure that thou
canst<br>
 remember them all, I cover them with this paper, and thou must
tell<br>
 over the tally to Lurgan Sahib. I will write mine.'</p>

<p>'Oah!' The instinct of competition waked in his breast. He
bent<br>
 over the tray. There were but fifteen stones on it. 'That is
easy,'<br>
 he said after a minute. The child slipped the paper over the<br>
 winking jewels and scribbled in a native account-book.</p>

<p><br>
 'There are under that paper five blue stones - one big, one<br>
 smaller, and three small,' said Kim, all in haste. 'There are
four<br>
 green stones, and one with a hole in it; there is one yellow
stone<br>
 that I can see through, and one like a pipe-stem. There are two
red<br>
 stones, and - and - I made the count fifteen, but two I have<br>
 forgotten. No! Give me time. One was of ivory, little and
brownish;<br>
 and - and - give me time...'</p>

<p>'One - two' - Lurgan Sahib counted him out up to ten. Kim
shook his<br>
 head.</p>

<p>'Hear my count!' the child burst in, trilling with
laughter.<br>
 'First, are two flawed sapphires - one of two ruttees and one
of<br>
 four as I should judge. The four-ruttee sapphire is chipped at
the<br>
 edge. There is one Turkestan turquoise, plain with black veins,
and<br>
 there are two inscribed - one with a Name of God in gilt, and
the<br>
 other being cracked across, for it came out of an old ring,
I<br>
 cannot read. We have now all five blue stones. Four flawed
emeralds<br>
 there are, but one is drilled in two places, and one is a
little<br>
 carven-'</p>

<p>'Their weights?' said Lurgan Sahib impassively.</p>

<p>'Three - five - five - and four ruttees as I judge it. There
is one<br>
 piece of old greenish pipe amber, and a cut topaz from
Europe.<br>
 There is one ruby of Burma, of two ruttees, without a flaw,
and<br>
 there is a balas-ruby, flawed, of two ruttees. There is a
carved<br>
 ivory from China representing a rat sucking an egg; and there
is<br>
 last - ah ha! - a ball of crystal as big as a bean set on a
gold<br>
 leaf.'</p>

<p>He clapped his hands at the close.</p>

<p>'He is thy master,' said Lurgan Sahib, smiling.</p>

<p>'Huh! He knew the names of the stones,' said Kim, flushing.
'Try<br>
 again! With common things such as he and I both know.'</p>

<p>They heaped the tray again with odds and ends gathered from
the<br>
 shop, and even the kitchen, and every time the child won, till
Kim<br>
 marvelled.</p>

<p>'Bind my eyes - let me feel once with my fingers, and even
then I<br>
 will leave thee opened-eyed behind,' he challenged.</p>

<p>Kim stamped with vexation when the lad made his boast
good.</p>

<p>'If it were men - or horses,' he said, 'I could do better.
This<br>
 playing with tweezers and knives and scissors is too
little.'</p>

<p>'Learn first - teach later,' said Lurgan Sahib. 'Is he thy
master?'</p>

<p>'Truly. But how is it done?'</p>

<p>'By doing it many times over till it is done perfectly - for
it is<br>
 worth doing.'</p>

<p>The Hindu boy, in highest feather, actually patted Kim on the
back.</p>

<p>'Do not despair,' he said. 'I myself will teach thee.'</p>

<p>'And I will see that thou art well taught,' said Lurgan
Sahib,<br>
 still speaking in the vernacular, 'for except my boy here - it
was<br>
 foolish of him to buy so much white arsenic when, if he had
asked,<br>
 I could have given it - except my boy here I have not in a
long<br>
 time met with one better worth teaching. And there are ten
days<br>
 more ere thou canst return to Lucknao where they teach nothing -
at<br>
 the long price. We shall, I think, be friends.'</p>

<p>They were a most mad ten days, but Kim enjoyed himself too
much to<br>
 reflect on their craziness. In the morning they played the
Jewel<br>
 Game - sometimes with veritable stones, sometimes with piles
of<br>
 swords and daggers, sometimes with photo-graphs of natives.
Through<br>
 the afternoons he and the Hindu boy would mount guard in the
shop,<br>
 sitting dumb behind a carpet-bale or a screen and watching
Mr<br>
 Lurgan's many and very curious visitors. There were small
Rajahs,<br>
 escorts coughing in the veranda, who came to buy curiosities -
such<br>
 as phonographs and mechanical toys. There were ladies in search
of<br>
 necklaces, and men, it seemed to Kim - but his mind may have
been<br>
 vitiated by early training - in search of the ladies; natives
from<br>
 independent and feudatory Courts whose ostensible business was
the<br>
 repair of broken necklaces - rivers of light poured out upon
the<br>
 table - but whose true end seemed to be to raise money for
angry<br>
 Maharanees or young Rajahs. There were Babus to whom Lurgan
Sahib<br>
 talked with austerity and authority, but at the end of each<br>
 interview he gave them money in coined silver and currency
notes.<br>
 There were occasional gatherings of long-coated theatrical
natives<br>
 who discussed metaphysics in English and Bengali, to Mr
Lurgan's<br>
 great edification. He was always interested in religions. At
the<br>
 end of the day, Kim and the Hindu boy - whose name varied at<br>
 Lurgan's pleasure - were expected to give a detailed account of
all<br>
 that they had seen and heard - their view of each man's
character,<br>
 as shown in his face, talk, and manner, and their notions of
his<br>
 real errand. After dinner, Lurgan Sahib's fancy turned more to
what<br>
 might be called dressing-up, in which game he took a most
informing<br>
 interest. He could paint faces to a marvel; with a brush-dab
here<br>
 and a line there changing them past recognition. The shop was
full<br>
 of all manner of dresses and turbans, and Kim was apparelled<br>
 variously as a young Mohammedan of good family, an oilman, and
once<br>
 - which was a joyous evening - as the son of an Oudh landholder
in<br>
 the fullest of full dress. Lurgan Sahib had a hawk's eye to
detect<br>
 the least flaw in the make-up; and lying on a worn teak-wood
couch,<br>
 would explain by the half-hour together how such and such a
caste<br>
 talked, or walked, or coughed, or spat, or sneezed, and,
since<br>
 'hows' matter little in this world, the 'why' of everything.
The<br>
 Hindu child played this game clumsily. That little mind, keen as
an<br>
 icicle where tally of jewels was concerned, could not temper
itself<br>
 to enter another's soul; but a demon in Kim woke up and sang
with<br>
 joy as he put on the changing dresses, and changed speech
and<br>
 gesture therewith.</p>

<p>Carried away by enthusiasm, he volunteered to show Lurgan
Sahib one<br>
 evening how the disciples of a certain caste of fakir, old
Lahore<br>
 acquaintances, begged doles by the roadside; and what sort
of<br>
 language he would use to an Englishman, to a Punjabi farmer
going<br>
 to a fair, and to a woman without a veil. Lurgan Sahib
laughed<br>
 immensely, and begged Kim to stay as he was, immobile for half
an<br>
 hour - cross-legged, ash-smeared, and wild-eyed, in the back
room.<br>
 At the end of that time entered a hulking, obese Babu whose<br>
 stockinged legs shook with fat, and Kim opened on him with a
shower<br>
 of wayside chaff. Lurgan Sahib - this annoyed Kim - watched
the<br>
 Babu and not the play.</p>

<p>'I think,' said the Babu heavily, lighting a cigarette, 'I am
of<br>
 opeenion that it is most extraordinary and effeecient
performance.<br>
 Except that you had told me I should have opined that- that-
that<br>
 you were pulling my legs. How soon can he become
approximately<br>
 effeecient chain-man? Because then I shall indent for him.'</p>

<p>'That is what he must learn at Lucknow.'</p>

<p>'Then order him to be jolly-dam'-quick. Good-night, Lurgan.'
The<br>
 Babu swung out with the gait of a bogged cow.</p>

<p>When they were telling over the day's list of visitors,
Lurgan<br>
 Sahib asked Kim who he thought the man might be.</p>

<p>'God knows!' said Kim cheerily. The tone might almost have
deceived<br>
 Mahbub Ali, but it failed entirely with the healer of sick
pearls.</p>

<p>'That is true. God, He knows; but I wish to know what you
think.'</p>

<p>Kim glanced sideways at his companion, whose eye had a way
of<br>
 compelling truth.</p>

<p>'I - I think he will want me when I come from the school, but'
-<br>
 confidentially, as Lurgan Sahib nodded approval - 'I do not<br>
 understand how he can wear many dresses and talk many
tongues.'</p>

<p>'Thou wilt understand many things later. He is a writer of
tales<br>
 for a certain Colonel. His honour is great only in Simla, and it
is<br>
 noticeable that he has no name, but only a number and a letter
-<br>
 that is a custom among us.'</p>

<p>'And is there a price upon his head too - as upon Mah - all
the<br>
 others?'</p>

<p>'Not yet; but if a boy rose up who is now sitting here and
went -<br>
 look, the door is open! - as far as a certain house with a
red-<br>
 painted veranda, behind that which was the old theatre in the
Lower<br>
 Bazar, and whispered through the shutters: "Hurree Chunder<br>
 Mookerjee bore the bad news of last month", that boy might
take<br>
 away a belt full of rupees.'</p>

<p>'How many?' said Kim promptly.</p>

<p>'Five hundred - a thousand - as many as he might ask for.'</p>

<p>'Good. And for how long might such a boy live after the news
was<br>
 told?' He smiled merrily at Lurgan's Sahib's very beard.</p>

<p>'Ah! That is to be well thought of. Perhaps if he were very
clever,<br>
 he might live out the day - but not the night. By no means
the<br>
 night.'</p>

<p>'Then what is the Babu's pay if so much is put upon his
head?'</p>

<p>'Eighty - perhaps a hundred - perhaps a hundred and fifty
rupees;<br>
 but the pay is the least he might be almost as great as Mahbub
Ali!<br>
 The housetops of his search should be half India; he would
follow<br>
 Kings and Ministers, as in the old days he had followed vakils
and<br>
 lawyers' touts across Lahore city for Mahbub Ali's sake.
Meantime,<br>
 there was the present, and not at all unpleasant, fact of St<br>
 Xavier's immediately before him. There would be new boys to<br>
 condescend to, and there would be tales of holiday adventures
to<br>
 hear. Young Martin, son of the tea-planter at Manipur, had
boasted<br>
 that he would go to war, with a rifle, against the
head-hunters.</p>

<p>That might be, but it was certain young Martin had not been
blown<br>
 half across the forecourt of a Patiala palace by an explosion
of<br>
 fireworks; nor had he... Kim fell to telling himself the story
of<br>
 his own adventures through the last three months. He could
paralyse<br>
 St Xavier's - even the biggest boys who shaved - with the
recital,<br>
 were that permitted. But it was, of course, out of the
question.<br>
 There would be a price upon his head in good time, as Lurgan
Sahib<br>
 had assured him; and if he talked foolishly now, not only would
that<br>
 price never be set, but Colonel part of the work. From time to
time,<br>
 God causes men to be born - and thou art one of them -who have
a<br>
 lust to go abroad at the risk of their lives and discover news
-<br>
 today it may be of far-off things, tomorrow of some hidden
mountain,<br>
 and the next day of some near-by men who have done a
foolishness<br>
 against the State. These souls are very few; and of these few,
not<br>
 more than ten are of the best. Among these ten I count the
Babu,<br>
 and that is curious. How great, therefore, and desirable must be
a<br>
 business that brazens the heart of a Bengali!'</p>

<p>'True. But the days go slowly for me. I am yet a boy, and it
is only<br>
 within two months I learned to write Angrezi. Even now I
cannot<br>
 read it well. And there are yet years and years and long
years<br>
 before I can be even a chain-man.'</p>

<p>'Have patience, Friend of all the World' - Kim started at the
title.<br>
 'Would I had a few of the years that so irk thee. I have proved
thee<br>
 in several small ways. This will not be forgotten when I make
my<br>
 report to the Colonel Sahib.' Then, changing suddenly into
English<br>
 with a deep laugh:</p>

<p>'By Jove! O'Hara, I think there is a great deal in you; but
you must<br>
 not become proud and you must not talk. You must go back to
Lucknow<br>
 and be a good little boy and mind your book, as the English say,
and<br>
 perhaps, next holidays if you care, you can come back to me!'
Kim's<br>
 face fell. 'Oh, I mean if you like. I know where you want to
go.'</p>

<p>Four days later a seat was booked for Kim and his small trunk
at the<br>
 rear of a Kalka tonga. His companion was the whale-like Babu,
who,<br>
 with a fringed shawl wrapped round his head, and his fat
openwork-<br>
 stockinged left leg tucked under him, shivered and grunted in
the<br>
 morning chill.</p>

<p>'How comes it that this man is one of us?' thought Kim
considering<br>
 the jelly back as they jolted down the road; and the
reflection<br>
 threw him into most pleasant day-dreams. Lurgan Sahib had given
him<br>
 five rupees - a splendid sum - as well as the assurance of
his<br>
 protection if he worked. Unlike Mahbub, Lurgan Sahib had spoken
most<br>
 explicitly of the reward that would follow obedience, and Kim
was<br>
 content. If only, like the Babu, he could enjoy the dignity of
a<br>
 letter and a number - and a price upon his head! Some day he
would<br>
 be all that and more. Some day he might be almost as great as
Mahbub<br>
 Ali! The housetops of his search should be half India; he
would<br>
 follow Kings and Ministers, as in the old days he had
followed<br>
 vakils and lawyers' touts across Lahore city for Mahbub Ali's
sake.<br>
 Meantime, there was the present, and not at all unpleasant, fact
of<br>
 St Xavier's immediately before him. There would be new boys
to<br>
 condescend to, and there would be tales of holiday adventures
to<br>
 hear. Young Martin, son of the tea-planter at Manipur, had
boasted<br>
 that he would go to war, with a rifle, against the
head-hunters.</p>

<p>That might be, but it was certain young Martin had not been
blown<br>
 half across the forecourt of a Patiala palace by an explosion

of<br>
 his own adventures through the last three months. He could
paralyse<br>
 St Xavier's - even the biggest boys who shaved - with the
recital,<br>
 were that permitted. But it was, of course, out of the
question.<br>
 There would be a price upon his head in good time, as Lurgan
Sahib<br>
 had assured him; and if he talked foolishly now, not only would
that<br>
 price never be set, but Colonel Creighton would cast him off -
and<br>
 he would be left to the wrath of Lurgan Sahib and Mahbub Ali -
for<br>
 the short space of life that would remain to him.</p>

<p>'So I should lose Delhi for the sake of a fish,' was his
proverbial<br>
 philosophy. It behoved him to forget his holidays (there
would<br>
 always remain the fun of inventing imaginary adventures) and,
as<br>
 Lurgan Sahib had said, to work. Of all the boys hurrying back to
St<br>
 Xavier's, from Sukkur in the sands to Galle beneath the palms,
none<br>
 was so filled with virtue as Kimball O'Rara, jiggeting down
to<br>
 Umballa behind Hurree Chunder Mookerjee, whose name on the books
of<br>
 one section of the Ethnological Survey was R.</p>

<p>And if additional spur were needed, the Babu supplied it.
After a<br>
 huge meal at Kalka, he spoke uninterruptedly. Was Kim going
to<br>
 school? Then he, an M A of Calcutta University, would explain
the<br>
 advantages of education. There were marks to be gained by
due<br>
 attention to Latin and Wordsworth's Excursion (all this was
Greek to<br>
 Kim). French, too was vital, and the best was to be picked up
in<br>
 Chandernagore a few miles from Calcutta. Also a man might go
far, as<br>
 he himself had done, by strict attention to plays called Lear
and<br>
 Julius Caesar, both much in demand by examiners. Lear was not
so<br>
 full of historical allusions as Julius Caesar; the book cost
four<br>
 annas, but could be bought second-hand in Bow Bazar for two.
Still<br>
 more important than Wordsworth, or the eminent authors, Burke
and<br>
 Hare, was the art and science of mensuration. A boy who had
passed<br>
 his examination in these branches - for which, by the way,
there<br>
 were no cram-books - could, by merely marching over a country
with a<br>
 compass and a level and a straight eye, carry away a picture of
that<br>
 country which might be sold for large sums in coined silver. But
as<br>
 it was occasionally inexpedient to carry about measuring-chains
a<br>
 boy would do well to know the precise length of his own
foot-pace,<br>
 so that when he was deprived of what Hurree Chunder called<br>
 adventitious aids' he might still tread his distances. To keep
count<br>
 of thousands of paces, Hurree Chunder's experience had shown
him<br>
 nothing more valuable than a rosary of eighty-one or a hundred
and<br>
 eight beads, for 'it was divisible and sub-divisible into
many<br>
 multiples and sub-multiples'. Through the volleying drifts
of<br>
 English, Kim caught the general trend of the talk, and it
interested<br>
 him very much. Here was a new craft that a man could tuck away
in<br>
 his head and by the look of the large wide world unfolding
itself<br>
 before him, it seemed that the more a man knew the better for
him.</p>

<p><br>
 Said the Babu when he had talked for an hour and a half 'I hope
some<br>
 day to enjoy your offeecial acquaintance. Ad interim, if I may
be<br>
 pardoned that expression, I shall give you this betel-box, which
is<br>
 highly valuable article and cost me two rupees only four years
ago.'<br>
 It was a cheap, heart-shaped brass thing with three compartments
for<br>
 carrying the eternal betel-nut, lime and pan-leaf; but it was
filled<br>
 with little tabloid-bottles. 'That is reward of merit for
your<br>
 performance in character of that holy man. You see, you are so
young<br>
 you think you will last for ever and not take care of your body.
It<br>
 is great nuisance to go sick in the middle of business. I am
fond of<br>
 drugs myself, and they are handy to cure poor people too. These
are<br>
 good Departmental drugs - quinine and so on. I give it you
for<br>
 souvenir. Now good-bye. I have urgent private business here by
the<br>
 roadside.'</p>

<p>He slipped out noiselessly as a cat, on the Umballa road,
hailed a<br>
 passing cart and jingled away, while Kim, tongue-tied, twiddled
the<br>
 brass betel-box in his hands.</p>

<p>The record of a boy's education interests few save his
parents, and,<br>
 as you know, Kim was an orphan. It is written in the books of
St<br>
 Xavier's in Partibus that a report of Kim's progress was
forwarded<br>
 at the end of each term to Colonel Creighton and to Father
Victor,<br>
 from whose hands duly came the money for his schooling. It
is<br>
 further recorded in the same books that he showed a great
aptitude<br>
 for mathematical studies as well as map-making, and carried away
a<br>
 prize (The Life of Lord Lawrence, tree-calf, two vols., nine
rupees,<br>
 eight annas) for proficiency therein; and the same term played
in St<br>
 Xavier's eleven against the Alighur Mohammedan College, his
age<br>
 being fourteen years and ten months. He was also re-vaccinated
(from<br>
 which we may assume that there had been another epidemic of
smallpox<br>
 at Lucknow) about the same time. Pencil notes on the edge of an
old<br>
 muster-roll record that he was punished several times for<br>
 'conversing with improper persons', and it seems that he was
once<br>
 sentenced to heavy pains for 'absenting himself for a day in
the<br>
 company of a street beggar'. That was when he got over the gate
and<br>
 pleaded with the lama through a whole day down the banks of
the<br>
 Gumti to accompany him on the Road next holidays - for one month
-<br>
 for a little week; and the lama set his face as a flint against
it,<br>
 averring that the time had not yet come. Kim's business, said
the<br>
 old man as they ate cakes together, was to get all the wisdom of
the<br>
 Sahibs and then he would see. The Hand of Friendship must in
some<br>
 way have averted the Whip of Calamity, for six weeks later Kim
seems<br>
 to have passed an examination in elementary surveying 'with
great<br>
 credit', his age being fifteen years and eight months. From
this<br>
 date the record is silent. His name does not appear in the
year's<br>
 batch of those who entered for the subordinate Survey of India,
but<br>
 against it stand the words 'removed on appointment.</p>

<p>Several times in those three years, cast up at the Temple of
the<br>
 Tirthankars in Benares the lama, a little thinner and a
shade<br>
 yellower, if that were possible, but gentle and untainted as
ever.<br>
 Sometimes it was from the South that he came - from south of<br>
 Tuticorin, whence the wonderful fire-boats go to Ceylon where
are<br>
 priests who know Pali; sometimes it was from the wet green West
and<br>
 the thousand cotton-factory chimneys that ring Bombay; and once
from<br>
 the North, where he had doubled back eight hundred miles to talk
for<br>
 a day with the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House. He
would<br>
 stride to his cell in the cool, cut marble - the priests of
the<br>
 Temple were good to the old man, - wash off the dust of travel,
make<br>
 prayer, and depart for Lucknow, well accustomed now to the way
of<br>
 the rail, in a third-class carriage. Returning, it was
noticeable,<br>
 as his friend the Seeker pointed out to the head-priest, that
he<br>
 ceased for a while to mourn the loss of his River, or to
draw<br>
 wondrous pictures of the Wheel of Life, but preferred to talk of
the<br>
 beauty and wisdom of a certain mysterious chela whom no man of
the<br>
 Temple had ever seen. Yes, he had followed the traces of the
Blessed<br>
 Feet throughout all India. (The Curator has still in his
possession<br>
 a most marvellous account of his wanderings and meditations.)
There<br>
 remained nothing more in life but to find the River of the
Arrow.<br>
 Yet it was shown to him in dreams that it was a matter not to
be<br>
 undertaken with any hope of success unless that seeker had with
him<br>
 the one chela appointed to bring the event to a happy issue,
and<br>
 versed in great wisdom - such wisdom as white-haired Keepers
of<br>
 Images possess. For example (here came out the snuff-gourd, and
the<br>
 kindly Jain priests made haste to be silent):</p>

<p>'Long and long ago, when Devadatta was King of Benares -let
all<br>
 listen to theTataka! - an elephant was captured for a time by
the<br>
 king's hunters and ere he broke free, beringed with a
grievous<br>
 legiron. This he strove to remove with hate and frenzy in his
heart,<br>
 and hurrying up and down the forests, besought his
brother-elephants<br>
 to wrench it asunder. One by one, with their strong trunks,
they<br>
 tried and failed. At the last they gave it as their opinion that
the<br>
 ring was not to be broken by any bestial power. And in a
thicket,<br>
 new-born, wet with moisture of birth, lay a day-old calf of the
herd<br>
 whose mother had died. The fettered elephant, forgetting his
own<br>
 agony, said: "If I do not help this suckling it will perish
under<br>
 our feet." So he stood above the young thing, making his
legs<br>
 buttresses against the uneasily moving herd; and he begged milk
of a<br>
 virtuous cow, and the calf throve, and the ringed elephant was
the<br>
 calf's guide and defence. Now the days of an elephant - let
all<br>
 listen to the Tataka! - are thirty-five years to his full
strength,<br>
 and through thirty-five Rains the ringed elephant befriended
the<br>
 younger, and all the while the fetter ate into the flesh.</p>

<p>'Then one day the young elephant saw the half-buried iron,
and<br>
 turning to the elder said: "What is this?" "It is even my
sorrow,"<br>
 said he who had befriended him. Then that other put out his
trunk<br>
 and in the twinkling of an eyelash abolished the ring, saying:
"The<br>
 appointed time has come." So the virtuous elephant who had
waited<br>
 temperately and done kind acts was relieved, at the appointed
time,<br>
 by the very calf whom he had turned aside to cherish - let
all<br>
 listen to the Tataka! for the Elephant was Ananda, and the
Calf<br>
 that broke the ring was none other than The Lord Himself...'</p>

<p>Then he would shake his head benignly, and over the
ever-clicking<br>
 rosary point out how free that elephant-calf was from the sin
of<br>
 pride. He was as humble as a chela who, seeing his master
sitting in<br>
 the dust outside the Gates of Learning, over-leapt the gates
(though<br>
 they were locked) and took his master to his heart in the
presence<br>
 of the proud-stomached city. Rich would be the reward of such
a<br>
 master and such a chela when the time came for them to seek
freedom<br>
 together!</p>

<p>So did the lama speak, coming and going across India as softly
as a<br>
 bat. A sharp-tongued old woman in a house among the
fruit-trees<br>
 behind Saharunpore honoured him as the woman honoured the
prophet,<br>
 but his chamber was by no means upon the wall. In an apartment
of<br>
 the forecourt overlooked by cooing doves he would sit, while
she<br>
 laid aside her useless veil and chattered of spirits and fiends
of<br>
 Kulu, of grandchildren unborn, and of the free-tongued brat who
had<br>
 talked to her in the resting-place. Once, too, he strayed alone
from<br>
 the Grand Trunk Road below Umballa to the very village whose
priest<br>
 had tried to drug him; but the kind Heaven that guards lamas
sent<br>
 him at twilight through the crops, absorbed and unsuspicious, to
the<br>
 Rissaldar's door. Here was like to have been a grave<br>
 misunderstanding, for the old soldier asked him why the Friend
of<br>
 the Stars had gone that way only six days before.</p>

<p>'That may not be,' said the lama. 'He has gone back to his
own<br>
 people.'</p>

<p>'He sat in that corner telling a hundred merry tales five
nights<br>
 ago,' his host insisted. 'True, he vanished somewhat suddenly in
the<br>
 dawn after foolish talk with my granddaughter. He grows apace,
but<br>
 he is the same Friend of the Stars as brought me true word of
the<br>
 war. Have ye parted?'</p>

<p>'Yes - and no,' the lama replied. 'We - we have not
altogether<br>
 parted, but the time is not ripe that we should take the
Road<br>
 together. He acquires wisdom in another place. We must
wait.'</p>

<p>'All one - but if it were not the boy how did he come to speak
so<br>
 continually of thee?'</p>

<p>'And what said he?' asked the lama eagerly.</p>

<p>'Sweet words - an hundred thousand - that thou art his father
and<br>
 mother and such all. Pity that he does not take the Qpeen's
service.<br>
 He is fearless.'</p>

<p>This news amazed the lama, who did not then know how
religiously Kim<br>
 kept to the contract made with Mahbub Ali, and perforce ratified
by<br>
 Colonel Creighton...</p>

<p>'There is no holding the young pony from the game,' said the
horse-<br>
 dealer when the Colonel pointed out that vagabonding over India
in<br>
 holiday time was absurd. 'If permission be refused to go and
come as<br>
 he chooses, he will make light of the refusal. Then who is to
catch<br>
 him? Colonel Sahib, only once in a thousand years is a horse
born so<br>
 well fitted for the game as this our colt. And we need men.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><br>
 Your tiercel's too long at hack, Sire. He's no eyass<br>
 But a passage-hawk that footed ere we caught him,<br>
 Dangerously free o' the air. Faith! were he mine<br>
 (As mine's the glove he binds to for his tirings)<br>
 I'd fly him with a make-hawk. He's in yarak<br>
 Plumed to the very point - so manned, so weathered ...<br>
 Give him the firmament God made him for,<br>
 And what shall take the air of him?</p>

<p>Gow's Watch</p>

<p>Lurgan Sahib did not use as direct speech, but his advice
tallied<br>
 with Mahbub's; and the upshot was good for Kim. He knew better
now<br>
 than to leave Lucknow city in native garb, and if Mahbub
were<br>
 anywhere within reach of a letter, it was to Mahbub's camp
he<br>
 headed, and made his change under the Pathan's wary eye.
Could<br>
 the little Survey paint-box that he used for map-tinting in
term-<br>
 time have found a tongue to tell of holiday doings, he might
have<br>
 been expelled. Once Mahbub and he went together as far as
the<br>
 beautiful city of Bombay, with three truckloads of tram-horses,
and<br>
 Mahbub nearly melted when Kim proposed a sail in a dhow across
the<br>
 Indian Ocean to buy Gulf Arabs, which, he understood from a
hanger-<br>
 on of the dealer Abdul Rahman, fetched better prices than
mere<br>
 Kabulis.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br>
 He dipped his hand into the dish with that great trader when
Mahbub<br>
 and a few co-religionists were invited to a big Haj dinner.
They<br>
 came back by way of Karachi by sea, when Kim took his first<br>
 experience of sea-sickness sitting on the fore-hatch of a
coasting-<br>
 steamer, well persuaded he had been poisoned. The Babu's
famous<br>
 drug-box proved useless, though Kim had restocked it at
Bombay.<br>
 Mahbub had business at Quetta, and there Kim, as Mahbub
admitted,<br>
 earned his keep, and perhaps a little over, by spending four
curious<br>
 days as scullion in the house of a fat Commissariat sergeant,
from<br>
 whose office-box, in an auspicious moment, he removed a
little<br>
 vellum ledger which he copied out - it seemed to deal entirely
with<br>
 cattle and camel sales - by moonlight, lying behind an outhouse,
all<br>
 through one hot night. Then he returned the ledger to its
place,<br>
 and, at Mahbub's word, left that service unpaid, rejoining him
six<br>
 miles down the road, the clean copy in his bosom.</p>

<p>'That soldier is a small fish,' Mahbub Ali explained, 'but in
time<br>
 we shall catch the larger one. He only sells oxen at two prices
-<br>
 one for himself and one for the Government which I do not think
is<br>
 a sin.'</p>

<p>'Why could not I take away the little book and be done with
it?'</p>

<p>Then he would have been frightened, and he would have told
his<br>
 master. Then we should miss, perhaps, a great number of new
rifles<br>
 which seek their way up from Quetta to the North. The Game is
so<br>
 large that one sees but a little at a time.'</p>

<p>'Oho!' said Kim, and held his tongue. That was in the
monsoon<br>
 holidays, after he had taken the prize for mathematics. The<br>
 Christmas holidays he spent - deducting ten days for private<br>
 amusements - with Lurgan Sahib, where he sat for the most part
in<br>
 front of a roaring wood-fire - Jakko road was four feet deep in
snow<br>
 that year - and - the small Hindu had gone away to be married
-<br>
 helped Lurgan to thread pearls. He made Kim learn whole chapters
of<br>
 the Koran by heart, till he could deliver them with the very
roll<br>
 and cadence of a mullah. Moreover, he told Kim the names and<br>
 properties of many native drugs, as well as the runes proper
to<br>
 recite when you administer them. And in the evenings he wrote
charms<br>
 on parchment - elaborate pentagrams crowned with the names of
devils<br>
 - Murra, and Awan the Companion of Kings - all fantastically
written<br>
 in the corners. More to the point, he advised Kim as to the care
of<br>
 his own body, the cure of fever-fits, and simple remedies of
the<br>
 Road. A week before it was time to go down, Colonel Creighton
Sahib<br>
 - this was unfair - sent Kim a written examination~paper
that<br>
 concerned itself solely with rods and chains and links and
angles.</p>

<p>Next holidays he was out with Mahbub, and here, by the way,
he<br>
 nearly died of thirst, plodding through the sand on a camel to
the<br>
 mysterious city of Bikanir, where the wells are four hundred
feet<br>
 deep, and lined throughout with camel-bone. It was not an
amusing<br>
 trip from Kim's point of view, because - in defiance of the
contract<br>
 - the Colonel ordered him to make a map of that wild, walled
city;<br>
 and since Mohammedan horse-boys and pipe-tenders are not
expected to<br>
 drag Survey-chains round the capital of an independent Native
State,<br>
 Kim was forced to pace all his distances by means of a bead
rosary.<br>
 He used the compass for bearings as occasion served - after
dark<br>
 chiefly, when the camels had been fed - and by the help of
his<br>
 little Survey paint-box of six colour-cakes and three brushes,
he<br>
 achieved something not remotely unlike the city of Jeysulmir.
Mahbub<br>
 laughed a great deal, and advised him to make up a written
report as<br>
 well; and in the back of the big account-book that lay under
the<br>
 flap of Mahbub's pet saddle Kim fell to work..</p>

<p>'It must hold everything that thou hast seen or touched or<br>
 considered. Write as though the Jung-i-Lat Sahib himself had
come by<br>
 stealth with a vast army outsetting to war.'</p>

<p>'How great an army?'</p>

<p>'Oh, half a lakh of men.'</p>

<p>'Folly! Remember how few and bad were the wells in the sand.
Not a<br>
 thousand thirsty men could come near by here.'</p>

<p>'Then write that down - also all the old breaches in the walls
and<br>
 whence the firewood is cut - and what is the temper and
disposition<br>
 of the King. I stay here till all my horses are sold. I will
hire a<br>
 room by the gateway, and thou shalt be my accountant. There is
a<br>
 good lock to the door.'</p>

<p>The report in its unmistakable St Xavier's running script, and
the<br>
 brown, yellow, and lake-daubed map, was on hand a few years ago
(a<br>
 careless clerk filed it with the rough notes of E's second
Seistan<br>
 survey), but by now the pencil characters must be almost
illegible.<br>
 Kim translated it, sweating under the light of an oil-lamp,
to<br>
 Mahbub, the second day of their return-journey.</p>

<p>The Pathan rose and stooped over his dappled saddle-bags.</p>

<p>'I knew it would be worthy a dress of honour, and so I made
one<br>
 ready,' he said, smiling. 'Were I Amir of Afghanistan (and some
day<br>
 we may see him), I would fill thy mouth with gold.' He laid
the<br>
 garments formally at Kim's feet. There was a
gold-embroidered<br>
 Peshawur turban-cap, rising to a cone, and a big turban-cloth
ending<br>
 in a broad fringe of gold. There was a Delhi embroidered
waistcoat<br>
 to slip over a milky white shirt, fastening to the right, ample
and<br>
 flowing; green pyjamas with twisted silk waist-string; and
that<br>
 nothing might be lacking, russia-leather slippers, smelling<br>
 divinely, with arrogantly curled tips.</p>

<p>'Upon a Wednesday, and in the morning, to put on new clothes
is<br>
 auspicious,' said Mahbub solemnly. 'But we must not forget
the<br>
 wicked folk in the world. So!'</p>

<p>He capped all the splendour, that was taking Kim's delighted
breath<br>
 away, with a mother-of-pearl, nickel-plated, self-extracting
.450<br>
 revolver.</p>

<p>'I had thought of a smaller bore, but reflected that this
takes<br>
 Government bullets. A man can always come by those -
especially<br>
 across the Border. Stand up and let me look.' He clapped Kim on
the<br>
 shoulder. 'May you never be tired, Pathan! Oh, the hearts to
be<br>
 broken! Oh, the eyes under the eyelashes, looking sideways!'</p>

<p>Kim turned about, pointed his toes, stretched, and felt
mechanically<br>
 for the moustache that was just beginning. Then he stooped
towards<br>
 Mahbub's feet to make proper acknowledgment with fluttering,
quick-<br>
 patting hands; his heart too full for words. Mahbub forestalled
and<br>
 embraced him.</p>

<p>'My son, said he, 'what need of words between us? But is not
the<br>
 little gun a delight? All six cartridges come out at one twist.
It<br>
 is borne in the bosom next the skin, which, as it were, keeps
it<br>
 oiled. Never put it elsewhere, and please God, thou shalt some
day<br>
 kill a man with it.'</p>

<p>'Hai mai!' said Kim ruefully. 'If a Sahib kills a man he is
hanged<br>
 in the jail.'</p>

<p>'True: but one pace beyond the Border, men are wiser. Put it
away;<br>
 but fill it first. Of what use is a gun unfed?'</p>

<p><br>
 'When I go back to the madrissah I must return it. They do not
allow<br>
 little guns. Thou wilt keep it for me?'</p>

<p><br>
 'Son, I am wearied of that madrissah, where they take the best
years<br>
 of a man to teach him what he can only learn upon the Road.
The<br>
 folly of the Sahibs has neither top nor bottom. No matter. Maybe
thy<br>
 written report shall save thee further bondage; and God He knows
we<br>
 need men more and more in the Game.'</p>

<p>They marched, jaw-bound against blowing sand, across the salt
desert<br>
 to Jodhpur, where Mahbub and his handsome nephew Habib Ullah
did<br>
 much trading; and then sorrowfully, in European clothes, which
he<br>
 was fast outgrowing, Kim went second-class to St Xavier's.
Three<br>
 weeks later, Colonel Creighton, pricing Tibetan ghost-daggers
at<br>
 Lurgan's shop, faced Mahbub Ali openly mutinous. Lurgan
Sahib<br>
 operated as support in reserve.</p>

<p>'The pony is made - finished - mouthed and paced, Sahib! From
now<br>
 on, day by day, he will lose his manners if he is kept at
tricks.<br>
 Drop the rein on his back and let go,' said the horse-dealer.
'We<br>
 need him.'</p>

<p>'But he is so young, Mahbub - not more than sixteen - is
he?'</p>

<p>'When I was fifteen, I had shot my man and begot my man,
Sahib.'</p>

<p>'You impenitent old heathen!' Creighton turned to Lurgan. The
black<br>
 beard nodded assent to the wisdom of the Afghan's dyed
scarlet.</p>

<p>'I should have used him long ago,' said Lurgan. 'The younger
the<br>
 better. That is why I always have my really valuable jewels
watched<br>
 by a child. You sent him to me to try. I tried him in every way:
he<br>
 is the only boy I could not make to see things.'</p>

<p>'In the crystal - in the ink-pool?' demanded Mahbub.</p>

<p>'No. Under my hand, as I told you. That has never happened
before.<br>
 It means that he is strong enough - but you think it
skittles,<br>
 Colonel Creighton - to make anyone do anything he wants. And
that is<br>
 three years ago. I have taught him a good deal since,
Colonel<br>
 Creighton. I think you waste him now.'</p>

<p>'Hmm! Maybe you're right. But, as you know, there is no Survey
work<br>
 for him at present.'</p>

<p>'Let him out let him go,' Mahbub interrupted. 'Who expects any
colt<br>
 to carry heavy weight at first? Let him run with the caravans -
like<br>
 our white camel-colts - for luck. I would take him myself, but
-,</p>

<p>'There is a little business where he would be most useful - in
the<br>
 South,' said Lurgan, with peculiar suavity, dropping his heavy
blued<br>
 eyelids.</p>

<p>'E has that in hand,' said Creighton quickly. 'He must not go
down<br>
 there. Besides, he knows no Turki.'</p>

<p>'Only tell him the shape and the smell of the letters we want
and he<br>
 will bring them back,' Lurgan insisted.</p>

<p>'No. That is a man's job,' said Creighton.</p>

<p>It was a wry-necked matter of unauthorized and incendiary<br>
 correspondence between a person who claimed to be the
ultimate<br>
 authority in all matters of the Mohammedan religion throughout
the<br>
 world, and a younger member of a royal house who had been
brought to<br>
 book for kidnapping women within British territory. The
Moslem<br>
 Archbishop had been emphatic and over-arrogant; the young prince
was<br>
 merely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges, but there was
no<br>
 need he should continue a correspondence which might some
day<br>
 compromise him. One letter indeed had been procured, but the
finder<br>
 was later found dead by the roadside in the habit of an Arab
trader,<br>
 as E, taking up the work, duly reported.</p>

<p>These facts, and a few others not to be published, made both
Mahbub<br>
 and Creighton shake their heads.</p>

<p>'Let him go out with his Red Lama,' said the horse-dealer
with<br>
 visible effort. 'He is fond of the old man. He can learn his
paces<br>
 by the rosary at least.'</p>

<p>'I have had some dealings with the old man - by letter,'
said<br>
 Colonel Creighton, smiling to himself. 'Whither goes he?'</p>

<p>'Up and down the land, as he has these three years. He seeks a
River<br>
 of Healing. God's curse upon all -' Mahbub checked himself. 'He
beds<br>
 down at the Temple of the Tirthankars or at Buddh Gaya when he
is in<br>
 from the Road. Then he goes to see the boy at the madrissah, as
we<br>
 know for the boy was punished for it twice or thrice. He is
quite<br>
 mad, but a peaceful man. I have met him. The Babu also has
had<br>
 dealings with him. We have watched him for three years. Red
Lamas<br>
 are not so common in Hind that one loses track.'</p>

<p>'Babus are very curious,' said Lurgan meditatively. 'Do you
know<br>
 what Hurree Babu really wants? He wants to be made a member of
the<br>
 Royal Society by taking ethnological notes. I tell you, I tell
him<br>
 about the lama everything which Mahbub and the boy have told
me.<br>
 Hurree Babu goes down to Benares - at his own expense, I
think.'</p>

<p>'I don't,' said Creighton briefly. He had paid Hurree's
travelling<br>
 expenses, out of a most lively curiosity to learn what the
lama<br>
 might be.</p>

<p>'And he applies to the lama for information on lamaism, and
devil-<br>
 dances, and spells and charms, several times in these few
years.<br>
 Holy Virgin! I could have told him all that yeears ago. I
think<br>
 Hurree Babu is getting too old for the Road. He likes better
to<br>
 collect manners and customs information. Yes, he wants to be an
FRS.</p>

<p>'Hurree thinks well of the boy, doesn't he?'</p>

<p>'Oh, very indeed - we have had some pleasant evenings at my
little<br>
 place - but I think it would be waste to throw him away with
Hurree<br>
 on the Ethnological side.'</p>

<p>'Not for a first experience. How does that strike you, Mahbub?
Let<br>
 the boy run with the lama for six months. After that we can see.
He<br>
 will get experience.'</p>

<p>'He has it already, Sahib - as a fish controls the water he
swims<br>
 in. But for every reason it will be well to loose him from
the<br>
 school.'</p>

<p>'Very good, then,' said Creighton, half to himself. 'He can go
with<br>
 the lama, and if Hurree Babu cares to keep an eye on them so
much<br>
 the better. He won't lead the boy into any danger as Mahbub
would.<br>
 Curious - his wish to be an F R S. Very human, too. He is best
on<br>
 the Ethnological side - Hurree.'</p>

<p>No money and no preferment would have drawn Creighton from his
work<br>
 on the Indian Survey, but deep in his heart also lay the
ambition to<br>
 write 'F R S' after his name. Honours of a sort he knew could
be<br>
 obtained by ingenuity and the help of friends, but, to the best
of<br>
 his belief, nothing save work -papers representing a life of it
-<br>
 took a man into the Society which he had bombarded for years
with<br>
 monographs on strange Asiatic cults and unknown customs. Nine
men<br>
 out of ten would flee from a Royal Society soiree in extremity
of<br>
 boredom; but Creighton was the tenth, and at times his soul
yearned<br>
 for the crowded rooms in easy London where silver-haired,
bald-<br>
 headed gentlemen who know nothing of the Army move among<br>
 spectroscopic experiments, the lesser plants of the frozen
tundras,<br>
 electric flight-measuring machines, and apparatus for slicing
into<br>
 fractional millimetres the left eye of the female mosquito. By
all<br>
 right and reason, it was the Royal Geographical that should
have<br>
 appealed to him, but men are as chancy as children in their
choice<br>
 of playthings. So Creighton smiled, and thought the better of
Hurree<br>
 Babu, moved by like desire.</p>

<p>He dropped the ghost-dagger and looked up at Mahbub.</p>

<p>'How soon can we get the colt from the stable?' said the
horse-<br>
 dealer, reading his eyes.</p>

<p>'Hmm! If I withdraw him by order now - what will he do, think
you? I<br>
 have never before assisted at the teaching of such an one.'</p>

<p>'He will come to me,' said Mahbub promptly. 'Lurgan Sahib and
I will<br>
 prepare him for the Road.'</p>

<p>'So be it, then. For six months he shall run at his choice.
But who<br>
 will be his sponsor?'</p>

<p>Lurgan slightly inclined his head. 'He will not tell anything,
if<br>
 that is what you are afraid of, Colonel Creighton.'</p>

<p>'It's only a boy, after all.'</p>

<p>'Ye-es; but first, he has nothing to tell; and secondly, he
knows<br>
 what would happen. Also, he is very fond of Mahbub, and of me
a<br>
 little.'</p>

<p>'Will he draw pay?' demanded the practical horse-dealer.</p>

<p>'Food and water allowance only. Twenty rupees a month.'</p>

<p>One advantage of the Secret Service is that it has no
worrying<br>
 audit. That Service is ludicrously starved, of course, but the
funds<br>
 are administered by a few men who do not call for vouchers
or<br>
 present itemized accounts. Mahbub's eyes lighted with almost
a<br>
 Sikh's love of money. Even Lurgan's impassive face changed.
He<br>
 considered the years to come when Kim would have been entered
and<br>
 made to the Great Game that never ceases day and night,
throughout<br>
 India. He foresaw honour and credit in the mouths of a chosen
few,<br>
 coming to him from his pupil. Lurgan Sahib had made E what E
was,<br>
 out of a bewildered, impertinent, lying, little North-West
Province<br>
 man.</p>

<p>But the joy of these masters was pale and smoky beside the joy
of<br>
 Kim when St Xavier's Head called him aside, with word that
Colonel<br>
 Creighton had sent for him.</p>

<p>'I understand, O'Hara, that he has found you a place as an
assistant<br>
 chain-man in the Canal Department: that comes of taking up<br>
 mathematics. It is great luck for you, for you are only sixteen;
but<br>
 of course you understand that you do not become pukka
[permanent]<br>
 till you have passed the autumn examination. So you must not
think<br>
 you are going out into the world to enjoy yourself, or that
your<br>
 fortune is made. There is a great deal of hard work before
you.<br>
 Only, if you succeed in becoming pukka, you can rise, you know,
to<br>
 four hundred and fifty a month.' Whereat the Principal gave him
much<br>
 good advice as to his conduct, and his manners, and his morals;
and<br>
 others, his elders, who had not been wafted into billets, talked
as<br>
 only Anglo-Indian lads can, of favouritism and corruption.
Indeed,<br>
 young Cazalet, whose father was a pensioner at Chunar, hinted
very<br>
 broadly that Colonel Creighton's interest in Kim was
directly<br>
 paternal; and Kim, instead of retaliating, did not even use<br>
 language. He was thinking of the immense fun to come, of
Mahbub's<br>
 letter of the day before, all neatly written in English,
making<br>
 appointment for that afternoon in a house the very name of
which<br>
 would have crisped the Principal's hair with horror...</p>

<p>Said Kim to Mahbub in Lucknow railway station that evening,
above<br>
 the luggage-scales: 'I feared lest at the last, the roof would
fall<br>
 upon me and cheat me. It is indeed all finished, O my
father?'</p>

<p>Mahbub snapped his fingers to show the utterness of that end,
and<br>
 his eyes blazed like red coals.</p>

<p>'Then where is the pistol that I may wear it?'</p>

<p>'Softly! A half-year, to run without heel-ropes. I begged that
much<br>
 from Colonel Creighton Sahib. At twenty rupees a month. Old Red
Hat<br>
 knows that thou art coming.'</p>

<p>'I will pay thee dustoorie [commission] on my pay for three
months,'<br>
 said Kim gravely. 'Yea, two rupees a month. But first we must
get<br>
 rid of these.' He plucked his thin linen trousers and dragged at
his<br>
 collar. 'I have brought with me all that I need on the Road.
My<br>
 trunk has gone up to Lurgan Sahib's.'</p>

<p>'Who sends his salaams to thee - Sahib.'</p>

<p>'Lurgan Sahib is a very clever man. But what dost thou
do?'</p>

<p>'I go North again, upon the Great Game. What else? Is thy mind
still<br>
 set on following old Red Hat?'</p>

<p>'Do not forget he made me that I am - though he did not know
it.<br>
 Year by year, he sent the money that taught me.'</p>

<p>'I would have done as much - had it struck my thick head,'
Mahbub<br>
 growled. 'Come away. The lamps are lit now, and none will mark
thee<br>
 in the bazar. We go to Huneefa's house.'</p>

<p>On the way thither, Mahbub gave him much the same sort of
advice as<br>
 his mother gave to Lemuel, and curiously enough, Mahbub was
exact to<br>
 point out how Huneefa and her likes destroyed kings.</p>

<p>'And I remember,' he quoted maliciously, 'one who said, "Trust
a<br>
 snake before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub
Ali."<br>
 Now, excepting as to Pathans, of whom I am one, all that is
true.<br>
 Most true is it in the Great Game, for it is by means of women
that<br>
 all plans come to ruin and we lie out in the dawning with
our<br>
 throats cut. So it happened to such a one.' He gave the
reddest<br>
 particulars.</p>

<p>'Then why -?' Kim paused before a filthy staircase that
climbed to<br>
 the warm darkness of an upper chamber, in the ward that is
behind<br>
 Azim Ullah's tobacco-shop. Those who know it call it The
Birdcage -<br>
 it is so full of whisperings and whistlings and chirrupings.</p>

<p>The room, with its dirty cushions and half-smoked hookahs,
smelt<br>
 abominably of stale tobacco. In one corner lay a huge and
shapeless<br>
 woman clad in greenish gauzes, and decked, brow, nose, ear,
neck,<br>
 wrist, arm, waist, and ankle with heavy native jewellery. When
she<br>
 turned it was like the clashing of copper pots. A lean cat in
the<br>
 balcony outside the window mewed hungrily. Kim checked,
bewildered,<br>
 at the door-curtain.</p>

<p>'Is that the new stuff, Mahbub?' said Huneefa lazily,
scarce<br>
 troubling to remove the mouthpiece from her lips. 'O Buktanoos!'
-<br>
 like most of her kind, she swore by the Djinns - 'O Buktanoos!
He is<br>
 very good to look upon.'</p>

<p><br>
 'That is part of the selling of the horse,' Mahbub explained to
Kim,<br>
 who laughed.</p>

<p>'I have heard that talk since my Sixth Day,' he replied,
squatting<br>
 by the light. 'Whither does it lead?'</p>

<p>'To protection. Tonight we change thy colour. This sleeping
under<br>
 roofs has blanched thee like an almond. But Huneefa has the
secret<br>
 of a colour that catches. No painting of a day or two. Also,
we<br>
 fortify thee against the chances of the Road. That is my gift
to<br>
 thee, my son. Take out all metals on thee and lay them here.
Make<br>
 ready, Huneefa.'</p>

<p>Kim dragged forth his compass, Survey paint-box, and the
new-filled<br>
 medicine-box. They had all accompanied his travels, and boylike
he<br>
 valued them immensely.</p>

<p>The woman rose slowly and moved with her hands a little
spread<br>
 before her. Then Kim saw that she was blind. 'No, no,' she
muttered,<br>
 'the Pathan speaks truth - my colour does not go in a week or
a<br>
 month, and those whom I protect are under strong guard.'</p>

<p>'When one is far off and alone, it would not be well to
grow<br>
 blotched and leprous of a sudden,' said Mahbub. 'When thou wast
with<br>
 me I could oversee the matter. Besides, a Pathan is a
fair-skin.<br>
 Strip to the waist now and look how thou art whitened.' Huneefa
felt<br>
 her way back from an inner room. 'It is no matter, she cannot
see.'<br>
 He took a pewter bowl from her ringed hand.</p>

<p>The dye-stuff showed blue and gummy. Kim experimented on the
back of<br>
 his wrist, with a dab of cotton-wool; but Huneefa heard him.</p>

<p>'No, no,' she cried, 'the thing is not done thus, but with
the<br>
 proper ceremonies. The colouring is the least part. I give thee
the<br>
 full protection of the Road.'</p>

<p>'Tadoo? [magic],'said Kim, with a half start. He did not like
the<br>
 white, sightless eyes. Mahbub's hand on his neck bowed him to
the<br>
 floor, nose within an inch of the boards.</p>

<p>'Be still. No harm comes to thee, my son. I am thy
sacrifice!'</p>

<p>He could not see what the woman was about, but heard the
dish-clash<br>
 of her jewellery for many minutes. A match lit up the darkness;
he<br>
 caught the well-known purr and fizzle of grains of incense. Then
the<br>
 room filled with smoke - heavy aromatic, and stupefying.
Through<br>
 growing drowse he heard the names of devils - of Zulbazan, Son
of<br>
 Eblis, who lives in bazars and paraos, making all the sudden
lewd<br>
 wickedness of wayside halts; of Dulhan, invisible about
mosques,<br>
 the dweller among the slippers of the faithful, who hinders
folk<br>
 from their prayers; and Musboot, Lord of lies and panic.
Huneefa,<br>
 now whispering in his ear, now talking as from an immense
distance,<br>
 touched him with horrible soft fingers, but Mahbub's grip
never<br>
 shifted from his neck till, relaxing with a sigh, the boy lost
his<br>
 senses.</p>

<p>'Allah! How he fought! We should never have done it but for
the<br>
 drugs. That was his white blood, I take it,' said Mahbub
testily.<br>
 'Go on with the dawut [invocation]. Give him full
Protection.'</p>

<p>'O Hearer! Thou that hearest with ears, be present. Listen,
O<br>
 Hearer!' Huneefa moaned, her dead eyes turned to the west. The
dark<br>
 room filled with moanings and snortings.</p>

<p>&gt;From the outer balcony, a ponderous figure raised a round
bullet<br>
 head and coughed nervously.</p>

<p>'Do not interrupt this ventriloquial necromanciss, my friend,'
it<br>
 said in English. 'I opine that it is very disturbing to you, but
no<br>
 enlightened observer is jolly-well upset.'</p>

<p>'..........I will lay a plot for their ruin! O Prophet, bear
with<br>
 the unbelievers. Let them alone awhile!' Huneefa's face, turned
to<br>
 the northward, worked horribly, and it was as though voices from
the<br>
 ceiling answered her.</p>

<p>Hurree Babu returned to his note-book, balanced on the
window-sill,<br>
 but his hand shook. Huneefa, in some sort of drugged
ecstasy,<br>
 wrenched herself to and fro as she sat cross-legged by Kim's
still<br>
 head, and called upon devil after devil, in the ancient order of
the<br>
 ritual, binding them to avoid the boy's every action.</p>

<p>'With Him are the keys of the Secret Things! None knoweth
them<br>
 besides Himself He knoweth that which is in the dry land and in
the<br>
 sea!' Again broke out the unearthly whistling responses.</p>

<p>'I - I apprehend it is not at all malignant in its operation?'
said<br>
 the Babu, watching the throat-muscles quiver and jerk as
Huneefa<br>
 spoke with tongues. 'It - it is not likely that she has killed
the<br>
 boy? If so, I decline to be witness at the trial .....What was
the<br>
 last hypothetical devil mentioned?'</p>

<p>'Babuji,' said Mahbub in the vernacular. 'I have no regard for
the<br>
 devils of Hind, but the Sons of Eblis are far otherwise, and
whether<br>
 they be jumalee [well-affected] or jullalee [terrible) they love
not<br>
 Kafirs.'</p>

<p>'Then you think I had better go?' said Hurree Babu, half
rising.<br>
 'They are, of course, dematerialized phenomena. Spencer says
'</p>

<p>Huneefa's crisis passed, as these things must, in a paroxysm
of<br>
 howling, with a touch of froth at the lips. She lay spent
and<br>
 motionless beside Kim, and the crazy voices ceased.</p>

<p>'Wah! That work is done. May the boy be better for it; and
Huneefa<br>
 is surely a mistress of dawut. Help haul her aside, Babu. Do not
be<br>
 afraid.'</p>

<p>'How am I to fear the absolutely non-existent?' said Hurree
Babu,<br>
 talking English to reassure himself. It is an awful thing still
to<br>
 dread the magic that you contemptuously investigate -to
collect<br>
 folk-lore for the Royal Society with a lively belief in all
Powers<br>
 of Darkness.</p>

<p>Mahbub chuckled. He had been out with Hurree on the Road ere
now.<br>
 'Let us finish the colouring,' said he. 'The boy is well
protected<br>
 if - if the Lords of the Air have ears to hear. I am a Sufi
[free-<br>
 thinker), but when one can get blind-sides of a woman, a
stallion,<br>
 or a devil, why go round to invite a kick? Set him upon the
way,<br>
 Babu, and see that old Red Hat does not lead him beyond our
reach. I<br>
 must get back to my horses.'</p>

<p>'All raight,' said Hurree Babu. 'He is at present curious<br>
 spectacle.'</p>

<p>About third cockcrow, Kim woke after a sleep of thousands of
years.<br>
 Huneefa, in her corner, snored heavily, but Mahbub was gone.</p>

<p>'I hope you were not frightened,' said an oily voice at his
elbow.<br>
 'I superintended entire operation, which was most interesting
from<br>
 ethnological point of view. It was high-class dawut.'</p>

<p>'Huh!' said Kim, recognizing Hurree Babu, who smiled
ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>'And also I had honour to bring down from Lurgan your
present<br>
 costume. I am not in the habit offeecially of carrying such
gauds to<br>
 subordinates, but' - he giggled - 'your case is noted as
exceptional<br>
 on the books. I hope Mr Lurgan will note my action.'</p>

<p>Kim yawned and stretched himself. It was good to turn and
twist<br>
 within loose clothes once again.</p>

<p>'What is this?' He looked curiously at the heavy duffle-stuff
loaded<br>
 with the scents of the far North.</p>

<p>'Oho! That is inconspicuous dress of chela attached to service
of<br>
 lamaistic lama. Complete in every particular,' said Hurree
Babu,<br>
 rolling into the balcony to clean his teeth at a goglet. 'I am
of<br>
 opeenion it is not your old gentleman's precise releegion,
but<br>
 rather sub-variant of same. I have contributed rejected notes
To<br>
 Whom It May Concern: Asiatic Quarterly Review on these subjects.
Now<br>
 it is curious that the old gentleman himself is totally devoid
of<br>
 releegiosity. He is not a dam' particular.'</p>

<p>'Do you know him?'</p>

<p>Hurree Babu held up his hand to show he was engaged in the<br>
 prescribed rites that accompany tooth-cleaning and such things
among<br>
 decently bred Bengalis. Then he recited in English an
Arya-Somaj<br>
 prayer of a theistical nature, and stuffed his mouth with pan
and<br>
 betel.</p>

<p>'Oah yes. I have met him several times at Benares, and also at
Buddh<br>
 Gaya, to interrogate him on releegious points and devil-worship.
He<br>
 is pure agnostic - same as me.'</p>

<p>Huneefa stirred in her sleep, and Hurree Babu jumped nervously
to<br>
 the copper incense-burner, all black and discoloured in
morning-<br>
 light, rubbed a finger in the accumulated lamp-black, and drew
it<br>
 diagonally across his face.</p>

<p>'Who has died in thy house?' asked Kim in the vernacular.</p>

<p>'None. But she may have the Evil Eye - that sorceress,' the
Babu<br>
 replied.</p>

<p>'What dost thou do now, then?'</p>

<p>'I will set thee on thy way to Benares, if thou goest thither,
and<br>
 tell thee what must be known by Us.'</p>

<p>'I go. At what hour runs the te-rain?' He rose to his feet,
looked<br>
 round the desolate chamber and at the yellow-wax face of Huneefa
as<br>
 the low sun stole across the floor. 'Is there money to be paid
that<br>
 witch?'</p>

<p>'No. She has charmed thee against all devils and all dangers
in the<br>
 name of her devils. It was Mahbub's desire.' In English: 'He
is<br>
 highly obsolete, I think, to indulge in such supersteetion. Why,
it<br>
 is all ventriloquy. Belly-speak - eh?'</p>

<p>Kim snapped his fingers mechanically to avert whatever evil
-<br>
 Mahbub, he knew, meditated none - might have crept in
through<br>
 Huneefa's ministrations; and Hurree giggled once more. But as
he<br>
 crossed the room he was careful not to step in Huneefa's
blotched,<br>
 squat shadow on the boards. Witches -when their time is on them
-<br>
 can lay hold of the heels of a man's soul if he does that.</p>

<p>'Now you must well listen,' said the Babu when they were in
the<br>
 fresh air. 'Part of these ceremonies which we witnessed they
include<br>
 supply of effeecient amulet to those of our Department. If you
feel<br>
 in your neck you will find one small silver amulet, verree
cheap.<br>
 That is ours. Do you understand?'</p>

<p>'Oah yes, hawa-dilli [a heart-lifter],' said Kim, feeling at
his<br>
 neck.</p>

<p>'Huneefa she makes them for two rupees twelve annas with - oh,
all<br>
 sorts of exorcisms. They are quite common, except they are
partially<br>
 black enamel, and there is a paper inside each one full of names
of<br>
 local saints and such things. Thatt is Huneefa's look-out, you
see?<br>
 Huneefa makes them onlee for us, but in case she does not, when
we<br>
 get them we put in, before issue, one small piece of turquoise.
Mr<br>
 Lurgan he gives them. There is no other source of supply; but it
was<br>
 me invented all this. It is strictly unoffeecial of course,
but<br>
 convenient for subordinates. Colonel Creighton he does not know.
He<br>
 is European. The turquoise is wrapped in the paper . . . Yes,
that<br>
 is road to railway station . . . Now suppose you go with the
lama,<br>
 or with me, I hope, some day, or with Mahbub. Suppose we get
into a<br>
 dam'-tight place. I am a fearful man - most fearful - but I tell
you<br>
 I have been in dam'-tight places more than hairs on my head.
You<br>
 say: "I am Son of the Charm." Verree good.'</p>

<p>'I do not understand quite. We must not be heard talking
English<br>
 here.'</p>

<p>'That is all raight. I am only Babu showing off my English to
you.<br>
 All we Babus talk English to show off;' said Hurree, flinging
his<br>
 shoulder-cloth jauntily. 'As I was about to say, "Son of the
Charm"<br>
 means that you may be member of the Sat Bhai - the Seven
Brothers,<br>
 which is Hindi and Tantric. It is popularly supposed to be
extinct<br>
 Society, but I have written notes to show it is still extant.
You<br>
 see, it is all my invention. Verree good. Sat Bhai has many
members,<br>
 and perhaps before they jolly-well-cut-your-throat they may give
you<br>
 just a chance of life. That is useful, anyhow. And moreover,
these<br>
 foolish natives - if they are not too excited - they always stop
to<br>
 think before they kill a man who says he belongs to any
speecific<br>
 organization. You see? You say then when you are in tight place,
"I<br>
 am Son of the Charm", and you get - perhaps - ah -your second
wind.<br>
 That is only in extreme instances, or to open negotiations with
a<br>
 stranger. Can you quite see? Verree good. But suppose now, I, or
any<br>
 one of the Department, come to you dressed quite different.
You<br>
 would not know me at all unless I choose, I bet you. Some day I
will<br>
 prove it. I come as Ladakhi trader - oh, anything - and I say
to<br>
 you: "You want to buy precious stones?" You say: "Do I look like
a<br>
 man who buys precious stones?" Then I say: "Even verree poor man
can<br>
 buy a turquoise or tarkeean." '</p>

<p>'That is kichree - vegetable curry,' said Kim.</p>

<p>'Of course it is. You say: "Let me see the tarkeean." Then I
say:<br>
 "It was cooked by a woman, and perhaps it is bad for your
caste."<br>
 Then you say: "There is no caste when men go to - look for<br>
 tarkeean." You stop a little between those words, "to - look".
That<br>
 is thee whole secret. The little stop before the words.'</p>

<p>Kim repeated the test-sentence.</p>

<p>'That is all right. Then I will show you my turquoise if there
is<br>
 time, and then you know who I am, and then we exchange views
and<br>
 documents and those-all things. And so it is with any other man
of<br>
 us. We talk sometimes about turquoises and sometimes about
tarkeean,<br>
 but always with that little stop in the words. It is verree
easy.<br>
 First, "Son of the Charm", if you are in a tight place. Perhaps
that<br>
 may help you - perhaps not. Then what I have told you about
the<br>
 tarkeean, if you want to transact offeecial business with a
strange<br>
 man. Of course, at present, you have no offeecial business. You
are<br>
 - ah ha! - supernumerary on probation. Quite unique specimen. If
you<br>
 were Asiatic of birth you might be employed right off; but
this<br>
 half-year of leave is to make you de~Englishized, you see? The
lama<br>
 he expects you, because I have demi-offeecially informed him
you<br>
 have passed all your examinations, and will soon obtain
Government<br>
 appointment. Oh ho! You are on acting-allowance, you see: so if
you<br>
 are called upon to help Sons of the Charm mind you jolly-well
try.<br>
 Now I shall say good-bye, my dear fellow, and I hope you - ah -
will<br>
 come out top-side all raight.'</p>

<p>Hurree Babu stepped back a pace or two into the crowd at
the<br>
 entrance of Lucknow station and -- was gone. Kim drew a deep
breath<br>
 and hugged himself all over. The nickel-plated revolver he
could<br>
 feel in the bosom of his sad-coloured robe, the amulet was on
his<br>
 neck; begging-gourd, rosary, and ghost-dagger (Mr Lurgan had<br>
 forgotten nothing) were all to hand, with medicine, paint-box,
and<br>
 compass, and in a worn old purse-belt embroidered with
porcupine-<br>
 quill patterns lay a month's pay. Kings could be no richer.
He<br>
 bought sweetmeats in a leaf-cup from a Hindu trader, and ate
them<br>
 with glad rapture till a policeman ordered him off the
steps.</p>

 Men to harm and cure again,<br>
 Snakes to charm and lure again -<br>
 He'll be hurt by his own blade,<br>
 By his serpents disobeyed,<br>
 By his clumsiness bewrayed,'<br>
 By the people mocked to scorn -<br>
 So 'tis not with juggler born!<br>
 Pinch of dust or withered flower,<br>
 Chance-flung fruit or borrowed staff,<br>
 Serve his need and shore his power,<br>
 Bind the spell, or loose the laugh!<br>
 But a man who, etc.</p>

<p>The Juggler's Song, op. 15</p>

<p><br>
 Followed a sudden natural reaction.</p>

<p>'Now am I alone all alone,' he thought. 'In all India is no
one so<br>
 alone as I! If I die today, who shall bring the news -and to
whom?<br>
 If I live and God is good, there will be a price upon my head,
for I<br>
 am a Son of the Charm - I, Kim.'</p>

<p>A very few white people, but many Asiatics, can throw
themselves<br>
 into a mazement as it were by repeating their own names over
and<br>
 over again to themselves, letting the mind go free upon
speculation<br>
 as to what is called personal identity. When one grows older,
the<br>
 power, usually, departs, but while it lasts it may descend upon
a man<br>
 at any moment.</p>

<p><br>
 'Who is Kim - Kim - Kim?'</p>

<p>He squatted in a corner of the clanging waiting-room, rapt
from all<br>
 other thoughts; hands folded in lap, and pupils contracted to
pin-<br>
 points. In a minute - in another half-second - he felt he
would<br>
 arrive at the solution of the tremendous puzzle; but here, as
always<br>
 happens, his mind dropped away from those heights with a rush of
a<br>
 wounded bird, and passing his hand before his eyes, he shook
his<br>
 head.</p>

<p>A long-haired Hindu bairagi [holy man], who had just bought
a<br>
 ticket, halted before him at that moment and stared
intently.</p>

<p>'I also have lost it,' he said sadly. 'It is one of the Gates
to the<br>
 Way, but for me it has been shut many years.'</p>

<p>'What is the talk?' said Kim, abashed.</p>

<p>'Thou wast wondering there in thy spirit what manner of thing
thy<br>
 soul might be. The seizure came of a sudden. I know. Who should
know<br>
 but I? Whither goest thou?'</p>

<p>'Toward Kashi [Benares].'</p>

<p>'There are no Gods there. I have proved them. I go to
Prayag<br>
 [Allahabad] for the fifth time - seeking the Road to
Enlightenment.<br>
 Of what faith art thou?'</p>

<p>'I too am a Seeker,' said Kim, using one of the lama's pet
words.<br>
 'Though'- he forgot his Northern dress for the moment -
'though<br>
 Allah alone knoweth what I seek.'</p>

<p>The old fellow slipped the bairagi's crutch under his armpit
and sat<br>
 down on a patch of ruddy leopard's skin as Kim rose at the call
for<br>
 the Benares train.</p>

<p>'Go in hope, little brother,' he said. 'It is a long road to
the<br>
 feet of the One; but thither do we all travel.'</p>

<p>Kim did not feel so lonely after this, and ere he had sat out
twenty<br>
 miles in the crowded compartment, was cheering his neighbours
with a<br>
 string of most wonderful yarns about his own and his
master's<br>
 magical gifts.</p>

<p>Benares struck him as a peculiarly filthy city, though it
was<br>
 pleasant to find how his cloth was respected. At least one-third
of<br>
 the population prays eternally to some group or other of the
many<br>
 million deities, and so reveres every sort of holy man. Kim
was<br>
 guided to the Temple of the Tirthankars, about a mile outside
the<br>
 city, near Sarnath, by a chance-met Punjabi farmer - a Kamboh
from<br>
 Jullundur-way who had appealed in vain to every God of his
homestead<br>
 to cure his small son, and was trying Benares as a last
resort.</p>

<p>'Thou art from the North?' he asked, shouldering through the
press<br>
 of the narrow, stinking streets much like his own pet bull at
home.</p>

<p>'Ay, I know the Punjab. My mother was a pahareen, but my
father came<br>
 from Amritzar - by Jandiala,' said Kim, oiling his ready tongue
for<br>
 the needs of the Road.</p>

<p>'Jandiala - Jullundur? Oho! Then we be neighbours in some
sort, as<br>
 it were.' He nodded tenderly to the wailing child in his arms.
'Whom<br>
 dost thou serve?'</p>

<p>'A most holy man at the Temple of the Tirthankers.'</p>

<p>'They are all most holy and - most greedy,' said the Jat
with<br>
 bitterness. 'I have walked the pillars and trodden the temples
till<br>
 my feet are flayed, and the child is no whit better. And the
mother<br>
 being sick too ... Hush, then, little one ... We changed his
name<br>
 when the fever came. We put him into girl's clothes. There
was<br>
 nothing we did not do, except - I said to his mother when
she<br>
 bundled me off to Benares -she should have come with me - I
said<br>
 Sakhi Sarwar Sultan would serve us best. We know His generosity,
but<br>
 these down-country Gods are strangers.'</p>

<p>The child turned on the cushion of the huge corded arms and
looked<br>
 at Kim through heavy eyelids.</p>

<p>'And was it all worthless?' Kim asked, with easy interest.</p>

<p>'All worthless - all worthless,' said the child, lips cracking
with<br>
 fever.</p>

<p>'The Gods have given him a good mind, at least' said the
father<br>
 proudly. 'To think he should have listened so cleverly. Yonder
is<br>
 thy Temple. Now I am a poor man - many priests have dealt with
me -<br>
 but my son is my son, and if a gift to thy master can cure him -
I<br>
 am at my very wits' end.'</p>

<p>Kim considered for a while, tingling with pride. Three years
ago he<br>
 would have made prompt profit on the situation and gone his
way<br>
 without a thought; but now, the very respect the Jat paid him
proved<br>
 that he was a man. Moreover, he had tasted fever once or
twice<br>
 already, and knew enough to recognize starvation when he saw
it.</p>

<p>'Call him forth and I will give him a bond on my best yoke, so
that<br>
 the child is cured.'</p>

<p>Kim halted at the carved outer door of the temple. A
white-clad<br>
 Oswal banker from Ajmir, his sins of usury new wiped out,
asked<br>
 him what he did.</p>

<p>'I am chela to Teshoo Lama, an Holy One from Bhotiyal -within
there.<br>
 He bade me come. I wait. Tell him.'</p>

<p>'Do not forget the child,' cried the importunate Jat over
his<br>
 shoulder, and then bellowed in Punjabi; 'O Holy One - O disciple
of<br>
 the Holy One - O Gods above all the Worlds -behold
affliction<br>
 sitting at the gate!' That cry is so common in Benares that
the<br>
 passers never turned their heads.</p>

<p>The Oswal, at peace with mankind, carried the message into
the<br>
 darkness behind him, and the easy, uncounted Eastern minutes
slid<br>
 by; for the lama was asleep in his cell, and no priest would
wake<br>
 him. When the click of his rosary again broke the hush of the
inner<br>
 court where the calm images of the Arhats stand, a novice
whispered,<br>
 'Thy chela is here,' and the old man strode forth, forgetting
the<br>
 end of that prayer.</p>

<p>Hardly had the tall figure shown in the doorway than the Jat
ran<br>
 before him, and, lifting up the child, cried: 'Look upon this,
Holy<br>
 One; and if the Gods will, he lives - he lives!'</p>

<p>He fumbled in his waist-belt and drew out a small silver
coin.</p>

<p>'What is now?' The lama's eyes turned to Kim. It was
noticeable he<br>
 spoke far clearer Urdu than long ago, under ZamZammah; but<br>
 father would allow no private talk.</p>

<p>'It is no more than a fever,' said Kim. 'The child is not well
fed.'</p>

<p>'He sickens at everything, and his mother is not here.'</p>

<p>'If it be permitted, I may cure, Holy One.'</p>

<p>'What! Have they made thee a healer? Wait here,' said the
lama, and<br>
 he sat down by the Jat upon the lowest step of the temple,
while<br>
 Kim, looking out of the corner of his eyes, slowly opened the
little<br>
 betel-box. He had dreamed dreams at school of returning to the
lama<br>
 as a Sahib - of chaffing the old man before he revealed himself
-<br>
 boy's dreams all. There was more drama in this abstracted,
brow-<br>
 puckered search through the tabloid-bottles, with a pause here
and<br>
 there for thought and a muttered invocation between whiles.
Quinine<br>
 he had in tablets, and dark brown meat-lozenges - beef most<br>
 probably, but that was not his business. The little thing would
not<br>
 eat, but it sucked at a lozenge greedily, and said it liked the
salt<br>
 taste.</p>

<p>'Take then these six.' Kim handed them to the man. 'Praise the
Gods,<br>
 and boil three in milk; other three in water. After he has drunk
the<br>
 milk give him this' (it was the half of a quinine pill), 'and
wrap<br>
 him warm. Give him the water of the other three, and the other
half<br>
 of this white pill when he wakes. Meantime, here is another
brown<br>
 medicine that he may suck at on the way home.'</p>

<p>'Gods, what wisdom!' said the Kamboh, snatching.</p>

<p>It was as much as Kim could remember of his own treatment in a
bout<br>
 of autumn malaria - if you except the patter that he added
to<br>
 impress the lama.</p>

<p>'Now go! Come again in the morning.'</p>

<p>'But the price - the price,' said the Jat, and threw back his
sturdy<br>
 shoulders. 'My son is my son. Now that he will be whole again,
how<br>
 shall I go back to his mother and say I took help by the wayside
and<br>
 did not even give a bowl of curds in return?'</p>

<p>'They are alike, these Jats,' said Kim softly. 'The Jat stood
on his<br>
 dunghill and the King's elephants went by. "O driver," said
he,<br>
 "what will you sell those little donkeys for?"'</p>

<p>The Jat burst into a roar of laughter, stifled with apologies
to the<br>
 lama. 'It is the saying of my own country the very talk of it.
So<br>
 are we Jats all. I will come tomorrow with the child; and
the<br>
 blessing of the Gods of the Homesteads - who are good little
Gods -<br>
 be on you both ... Now, son, we grow strong again. Do not spit
it<br>
 out, little Princeling! King of my Heart, do not spit it out,
and we<br>
 shall be strong men, wrestlers and club-wielders, by
morning.'</p>

<p>He moved away, crooning and mumbling. The lama turned to Kim,
and<br>
 all the loving old soul of him looked out through his narrow
eyes.</p>

<p>'To heal the sick is to acquire merit; but first one gets
knowledge.<br>
 That was wisely done, O Friend of all the World.'</p>

<p>'I was made wise by thee, Holy One,' said Kim, forgetting the
little<br>
 play just ended; forgetting St Xavier's; forgetting his white
blood;<br>
 forgetting even the Great Game as he stooped,
Mohammedan-fashion, to<br>
 touch his master's feet in the dust of the Jain temple. 'My
teaching<br>
 I owe to thee. I have eaten thy bread three years. My time
is<br>
 finished. I am loosed from the schools. I come to thee.'</p>

<p>'Herein is my reward. Enter! Enter! And is all well?' They
passed to<br>
 the inner court, where the afternoon sun sloped golden
across.<br>
 'Stand that I may see. So!' He peered critically. 'It is no
longer a<br>
 child, but a man, ripened in wisdom, walking as a physician. I
did<br>
 well - I did well when I gave thee up to the armed men on that
black<br>
 night. Dost thou remember our first day under Zam-Zammah?'</p>

<p>'Ay,' said Kim. 'Dost thou remember when I leapt off the
carriage<br>
 the first day I went to -'</p>

<p>'The Gates of Learning? Truly. And the day that we ate the
cakes<br>
 together at the back of the river by Nucklao. Aha! Many times
hast<br>
 thou begged for me, but that day I begged for thee.'</p>

<p>'Good reason,' quoth Kim. 'I was then a scholar in the Gates
of<br>
 Learning, and attired as a Sahib. Do not forget, Holy One,' he
went<br>
 on playfully. 'I am still a Sahib - by thy favour.'</p>

<p>'True. And a Sahib in most high esteem. Come to my cell,
chela.'</p>

<p>'How is that known to thee?'</p>

<p>The lama smiled. 'First by means of letters from the kindly
priest<br>
 whom we met in the camp of armed men; but he is now gone to his
own<br>
 country, and I sent the money to his brother.' Colonel
Creighton,<br>
 who had succeeded to the trusteeship when Father Victor went
to<br>
 England with the Mavericks, was hardly the Chaplain's brother.
'But<br>
 I do not well understand Sahibs' letters. They must be
interpreted<br>
 to me. I chose a surer way. Many times when I returned from
my<br>
 Search to this Temple, which has always been a nest to me,
there<br>
 came one seeking Enlightenment - a man from Leh - that had been,
he<br>
 said, a Hindu, but wearied of all those Gods.' The lama pointed
to<br>
 the Arhats.</p>

<p><br>
 'A fat man?' said Kim, a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>'Very fat; but I perceived in a little his mind was wholly
given up<br>
 to useless things - such as devils and charms and the form
and<br>
 fashion of our tea-drinkings in the monasteries, and by what
road we<br>
 initiated the novices. A man abounding in questions; but he was
a<br>
 friend of thine, chela. He told me that thou wast on the road
to<br>
 much honour as a scribe. And I see thou art a physician.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that am I - a scribe, when I am a Sahib, but it is set
aside<br>
 when I come as thy disciple. I have accomplished the years
appointed<br>
 for a Sahib.'</p>

<p>'As it were a novice?' said the lama, nodding his head. 'Art
thou<br>
 freed from the schools? I would not have thee unripe.'</p>

<p>'I am all free. In due time I take service under the
Government as a<br>
 scribe -'</p>

<p>'Not as a warrior. That is well.'</p>

<p>'But first I come to wander with thee. Therefore I am here.
Who<br>
 begs for thee, these days?' he went on quickly. The ice was
thin.</p>

<p>'Very often I beg myself; but, as thou knowest, I am seldom
here,<br>
 except when I come to look again at my disciple. From one end
to<br>
 another of Hind have I travelled afoot and in the te-rain. A
great<br>
 and a wonderful land! But here, when I put in, is as though I
were<br>
 in mv own Bhotiyal.'</p>

<p>He looked round the little clean cell complacently. A low
cushion<br>
 gave him a seat, on which he had disposed himself in the
cross-<br>
 legged attitude of the Bodhisat emerging from meditation; a
black<br>
 teak-wood table, not twenty inches high, set with copper
tea-cups,<br>
 was before him. In one corner stood a tiny altar, also of
heavily<br>
 carved teak, bearing a copper-gilt image of the seated Buddha
and<br>
 fronted by a lamp, an incense-holder, and a pair of copper
flower-<br>
 pots.</p>

<p>'The Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House acquired merit
by<br>
 giving me these a year since,' he said, following Kim's eye.
'When<br>
 one is far from one's own land such things carry remembrance;
and we<br>
 must reverence the Lord for that He showed the Way. See!' He
pointed<br>
 to a curiously-built mound of coloured rice crowned with a
fantastic<br>
 metal ornament. 'When I was Abbot in my own place - before I
came to<br>
 better knowledge I made that offering daily. It is the Sacrifice
of<br>
 the Universe to the Lord. Thus do we of Bhotiyal offer all the
world<br>
 daily to the Excellent Law. And I do it even now, though I know
that<br>
 the Excellent One is beyond all pinchings and pattings.' He
snuffed<br>
 from his gourd.</p>

<p>'It is well done, Holy One,' Kim murmured, sinking at ease on
the<br>
 cushions, very happy and rather tired.</p>

<p>'And also,' the old man chuckled, 'I write pictures of the
Wheel of<br>
 Life. Three days to a picture. I was busied on it - or it may be
I<br>
 shut my eyes a little - when they brought word of thee. It is
good<br>
 to have thee here: I will show thee my art - not for pride's
sake,<br>
 but because thou must learn. The Sahibs have not all this
world's<br>
 wisdom.'</p>

<p>He drew from under the table a sheet of strangely scented
yellow<br>
 Chinese paper, the brushes, and slab of Indian ink. In
cleanest,<br>
 severest outline he had traced the Great Wheel with its six
spokes,<br>
 whose centre is the conjoined Hog, Snake, and Dove
(Ignorance,<br>
 Anger, and Lust), and whose compartments are all the Heavens
and<br>
 Hells, and all the chances of human life. Men say that the
Bodhisat<br>
 Himself first drew it with grains of rice upon dust, to teach
His<br>
 disciples the cause of things. Many ages have crystallized it
into a<br>
 most wonderful convention crowded with hundreds of little
figures<br>
 whose every line carries a meaning. Few can translate the
picture-<br>
 parable; there are not twenty in all the world who can draw
it<br>
 surely without a copy: of those who can both draw and expound
are<br>
 but three.</p>

<p>'I have a little learned to draw,' said Kim. 'But this is a
marvel<br>
 beyond marvels.'</p>

<p>'I have written it for many years,' said the lama. 'Time was
when I<br>
 could write it all between one lamp-lighting and the next. I
will<br>
 teach thee the art - after due preparation; and I will show thee
the<br>
 meaning of the Wheel.'</p>

<p>'We take the Road, then?'</p>

<p>'The Road and our Search. I was but waiting for thee. It was
made<br>
 plain to me in a hundred dreams - notably one that came upon
the<br>
 night of the day that the Gates of Learning first shut that
without<br>
 thee I should never find my River. Again and again, as thou
knowest,<br>
 I put this from me, fearing an illusion. Therefore I would not
take<br>
 thee with me that day at Lucknow, when we ate the cakes. I would
not<br>
 take thee till the. time was ripe and auspicious. From the Hills
to<br>
 the Sea, from the Sea to the Hills have I gone, but it was
vain.<br>
 Then I remembered the Tataka.'</p>

<p>He told Kim the story of the elephant with the leg-iron, as he
had<br>
 told it so often to the Jam priests.</p>

<p>'Further testimony is not needed,' he ended serenely. 'Thou
wast<br>
 sent for an aid. That aid removed, my Search came to naught.<br>
 Therefore we will go out again together, and our Search
sure.'</p>

<p>'Whither go we?'</p>

<p>'What matters, Friend of all the World? The Search, I say, is
sure.<br>
 If need be, the River will break from the ground before us.
I<br>
 acquired merit when I sent thee to the Gates of Learning, and
gave<br>
 thee the jewel that is Wisdom. Thou didst return, I saw even
now, a<br>
 follower of Sakyamuni, the Physician, whose altars are many
in<br>
 Bhotiyal. It is sufficient. We are together, and all things are
as<br>
 they were - Friend of all the World -Friend of the Stars -
my<br>
 chela!'</p>

<p>Then they talked of matters secular; but it was noticeable
that the<br>
 lama never demanded any details of life at St Xavier's, nor
showed<br>
 the faintest curiosity as to the manners and customs of Sahibs.
His<br>
 mind moved all in the past, and he revived every step of
their<br>
 wonderful first journey together, rubbing his hands and
chuckling,<br>
 till it pleased him to curl himself up into the sudden sleep of
old<br>
 age.</p>

<p>Kim watched the last dusty sunshine fade out of the court,
and<br>
 played with his ghost-dagger and rosary. The clamour of
Benares,<br>
 oldest of all earth's cities awake before the Gods, day and
night,<br>
 beat round the walls as the sea's roar round a breakwater. Now
and<br>
 again, a Jain priest crossed the court, with some small offering
to<br>
 the images, and swept the path about him lest by chance he
should<br>
 take the life of a living thing. A lamp twinkled, and there
followed<br>
 the sound of a prayer. Kim watched the stars as they rose one
after<br>
 another in the still, sticky dark, till he fell asleep at the
foot<br>
 of the altar. That night he dreamed in Hindustani, with never
an<br>
 English word...</p>

<p>'Holy One, there is the child to whom we gave the medicine,'
he<br>
 said, about three o'clock in the morning, when the lama, also
waking<br>
 from dreams, would have fared forth on pilgrimage. 'The Jat will
be<br>
 here at the light.'</p>

<p>'I am well answered. In my haste I would have done a wrong.'
He sat<br>
 down on the cushions and returned to his rosary. 'Surely old
folk<br>
 are as children,' he said pathetically. 'They desire a matter
-<br>
 behold, it must be done at once, or they fret and weep! Many
times<br>
 when I was upon the Road I have been ready to stamp with my feet
at<br>
 the hindrance of an ox-cart in the way, or a mere cloud of
dust.<br>
 It was not so when I was a man - a long time ago. None the less
it<br>
 is wrongful -'</p>

<p>'But thou art indeed old, Holy One.'</p>

<p>'The thing was done. A Cause was put out into the world, and,
old or<br>
 young, sick or sound, knowing or unknowing, who can rein in
the<br>
 effect of that Cause? Does the Wheel hang still if a child spin
it -<br>
 or a drunkard? Chela, this is a great and a terrible world.'</p>

<p>'I think it good,' Kim yawned. 'What is there to eat? I have
not<br>
 eaten since yesterday even.'</p>

<p>'I had forgotten thy need. Yonder is good Bhotiyal tea and
cold<br>
 rice.'</p>

<p>'We cannot walk far on such stuff.' Kim felt all the
European's lust<br>
 for flesh-meat, which is not accessible in a Jain temple.
Yet,<br>
 instead of going out at once with the begging-bowl, he stayed
his<br>
 stomach on slabs of cold rice till the full dawn. It brought
the<br>
 farmer, voluble, stuttering with gratitude.</p>

<p>'In the night the fever broke and the sweat came, he cried.
'Feel<br>
 here - his skin is fresh and new! He esteemed the salt lozenges,
and<br>
 took milk with greed.' He drew the cloth from the child's face,
and<br>
 it smiled sleepily at Kim. A little knot of Jain priests,
silent<br>
 but all-observant, gathered by the temple door. They knew, and
Kim<br>
 knew that they knew, how the old lama had met his disciple.
Being<br>
 courteous folk, they had not obtruded themselves overnight
by<br>
 presence, word, or gesture. Wherefore Kim repaid them as the
sun<br>
 rose.</p>

<p>'Thank the Gods of the Jains, brother,' he said, not knowing
how<br>
 those Gods were named. 'The fever is indeed broken.'</p>

<p>'Look! See!' The lama beamed in the background upon his hosts
of<br>
 three years. 'Was there ever such a chela? He follows our Lord
the<br>
 Healer.'</p>

<p>Now the Jains officially recognize all the Gods of the Hindu
creed,<br>
 as well as the Lingam and the Snake. They wear the
Brahminical<br>
 thread; they adhere to every claim of Hindu caste-law. But,
because<br>
 they knew and loved the lama, because he was an old man, because
he<br>
 sought the Way, because he was their guest, and because he
collogued<br>
 long of nights with the head-priest - as free-thinking a<br>
 metaphysician as ever split one hair into seventy - they
murmured<br>
 assent.</p>

<p>'Remember,' - Kim bent over the child -. 'this trouble may
come<br>
 again.</p>

<p>'Not if thou hast the proper spell,' said the father.</p>

<p>'But in a little while we go away.'</p>

<p>'True,' said the lama to all the Jains. 'We go now together
upon the<br>
 Search whereof I have often spoken. I waited till my chela was
ripe.<br>
 Behold him! We go North. Never again shall I look upon this
place of<br>
 my rest, O people of good will.'</p>

<p>'But I am not a beggar.' The cultivator rose to his feet,
clutching<br>
 the child.</p>

<p>'Be still. Do not trouble the Holy One,' a priest cried.</p>

<p>'Go,' Kim whispered. 'Meet us again under the big railway
bridge,<br>
 and for the sake of all the Gods of our Punjab, bring food -
curry,<br>
 pulse, cakes fried in fat, and sweetmeats. Specially sweetmeats.
Be<br>
 swift!'</p>

<p>The pallor of hunger suited Kim very well as he stood, tall
and<br>
 slim, in his sand-coloured, sweeping robes, one hand on his
rosary<br>
 and the other in the attitude of benediction, faithfully copied
from<br>
 the lama. An English observer might have said that he looked
rather<br>
 like the young saint of a stained-glass window, whereas he was
but a<br>
 growing lad faint with emptiness.</p>

<p>Long and formal were the farewells, thrice ended and thrice
renewed.<br>
 The Seeker - he who had invited the lama to that haven from
far-<br>
 away Tibet, a silver-faced, hairless ascetic -took no part in
it,<br>
 but meditated, as always, alone among the images. The others
were<br>
 very human; pressing small comforts upon the old man - a
betel-box,<br>
 a fine new iron pencase, a food-bag, and such-like - warning
him<br>
 against the dangers of the world without, and prophesying a
happy<br>
 end to the Search. Meantime Kim, lonelier than ever, squatted on
the<br>
 steps, and swore to himself in the language of St Xavier's.</p>

<p>'But it is my own fault,' he concluded. 'With Mahbub, I ate
Mahbub's<br>
 bread, or Lurgan Sahib's. At St Xavier's, three meals a day.
Here I<br>
 must jolly-well look out for myself. Besides, I am not in
good<br>
 training. How I could eat a plate of beef now! ... Is it
finished,<br>
 Holy One?'</p>

<p>The lama, both hands raised, intoned a final blessing in
ornate<br>
 Chinese. 'I must lean on thy shoulder,' said he, as the temple
gates<br>
 closed. 'We grow stiff, I think.'</p>

<p>The weight of a six-foot man is not light to steady through
miles of<br>
 crowded streets, and Kim, loaded down with bundles and packages
for<br>
 the way, was glad to reach the shadow of the railway bridge.</p>

<p>'Here we eat,' he said resolutely, as the Kamboh, blue-robed
and<br>
 smiling, hove in sight, a basket in one hand and the child in
the<br>
 other.</p>

<p>'Fall to, Holy Ones!' he cried from fifty yards. (They were by
the<br>
 shoal under the first bridge-span, out of sight of hungry
priests.)<br>
 'Rice and good curry, cakes all warm and well scented with
king<br>
 [asafoetida), curds and sugar. King of my fields,' -this to
the<br>
 small son - 'let us show these holy men that we Jats of
Jullundur<br>
 can pay a service . . . I had heard the Jams would eat nothing
that<br>
 they had not cooked, but truly' - he looked away politely over
the<br>
 broad river - 'where there is no eye there is no caste.'</p>

<p>'And we,' said Kim, turning his back and heaping a leafplatter
for<br>
 the lama, 'are beyond all castes.'</p>

<p><br>
 They gorged themselves on the good food in silence. Nor till he
had<br>
 licked the last of the sticky sweetstuff from his little finger
did<br>
 Kim note that the Kamboh too was girt for travel.</p>

<p>'If our roads lie together,' he said roughly, 'I go with thee.
One<br>
 does not often find a worker of miracles, and the child is
still<br>
 weak. But I am not altogether a reed.' He picked up his lathi -
a<br>
 five-foot male-bamboo ringed with bands of polished iron -
and<br>
 flourished it in the air. 'The Jats are called quarrel-some,
but<br>
 that is not true. Except when we are crossed, we are like our
own<br>
 buffaloes.'</p>

<p>'So be it,' said Kim. 'A good stick is a good reason.'</p>

<p>The lama gazed placidly up-stream, where in long, smudged<br>
 perspective the ceaseless columns of smoke go up from the
burning-<br>
 ghats by the river. Now and again, despite all municipal<br>
 regulations, the fragment of a half-burned body bobbed by on
the<br>
 full current.</p>

<p>'But for thee,' said the Kamboh to Kim, drawing the child into
his<br>
 hairy breast, 'I might today have gone thither - with this one.
The<br>
 priests tell us that Benares is holy - which none doubt -
and<br>
 desirable to die in. But I do not know their Gods, and they ask
for<br>
 money; and when one has done one worship a shaved-head vows it
is of<br>
 none effect except one do another. Wash here! Wash there!
Pour,<br>
 drink, lave, and scatter flowers -but always pay the priests.
No,<br>
 the Punjab for me, and the soil of the Jullundur-doab for the
best<br>
 soil in it.</p>

<p>'I have said many times - in the Temple, I think - that if
need be,<br>
 the River will open at our feet. We will therefore go North,'
said<br>
 the lama, rising. 'I remember a pleasant place, set about
with<br>
 fruit-trees, where one can walk in meditation - and the air
is<br>
 cooler there. It comes from the Hills and the snow of the
Hills.'</p>

<p>'What is the name?' said Kim.</p>

<p>'How should I know? Didst thou not - no, that was after the
Army<br>
 rose out of the earth and took thee away. I abode there in<br>
 meditation in a room against the dovecot - except when she
talked<br>
 eternally.'</p>

<p>'Oho! the woman from Kulu. That is by Saharunpore.' Kim
laughed.</p>

<p>'How does the spirit move thy master? Does he go afoot, for
the sake<br>
 of past sins?' the Jat demanded cautiously. 'It is a far cry
to<br>
 Delhi.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Kim. 'I will beg a tikkut for the te-rain.' One
does not<br>
 own to the possession of money in India.</p>

<p>'Then, in the name of the Gods, let us take the fire-carriage.
My<br>
 son is best in his mother's arms. The Government has brought on
us<br>
 many taxes, but it gives us one good thing - the te-rain that
joins<br>
 friends and unites the anxious. A wonderful matter is the
te-rain.'</p>

<p>They all piled into it a couple of hours later, and slept
through<br>
 the heat of the day. The Kamboh plied Kim with ten thousand<br>
 questions as to the lama's walk and work in life, and received
some<br>
 curious answers. Kim was content to be where he was, to look
out<br>
 upon the flat North-Western landscape, and to talk to the<br>
 changing mob of fellow-passengers. Even today, tickets and
ticket-<br>
 clipping are dark oppression to Indian rustics. They do not<br>
 understand why, when they have paid for a magic piece of
paper,<br>
 strangers should punch great pieces out of the charm. So, long
and<br>
 furious are the debates between travellers and Eurasian
ticket-<br>
 collectors. Kim assisted at two or three with grave advice,
meant to<br>
 darken counsel and to show off his wisdom before the lama and
the<br>
 admiring Kamboh. But at Somna Road the Fates sent him a matter
to<br>
 think upon. There tumbled into the compartment, as the train
was<br>
 moving off, a mean, lean little person - a Mahratta, so far as
Kim<br>
 could judge by the cock of the tight turban. His face was cut,
his<br>
 muslin upper-garment was badly torn, and one leg was bandaged.
He<br>
 told them that a country-cart had upset and nearlv slain him:
he<br>
 was going to Delhi, where his son lived. Kim watched him
closely.<br>
 If, as he asserted, he had been rolled over and over on the
earth,<br>
 there should have been signs of gravel-rash on the skin. But all
his<br>
 injuries seemed clean cuts, and a mere fall from a cart could
not<br>
 cast a man into such extremity of terror. As, with shaking
fingers,<br>
 he knotted up the torn cloth about his neck he laid bare an
amulet<br>
 of the kind called a keeper-up of the heart. Now, amulets are
common<br>
 enough, but they are not generally strung on square-plaited
copper<br>
 wire, and still fewer amulets bear black enamel on silver.
There<br>
 were none except the Kamboh and the lama in the compartment,
which,<br>
 luckily, was of an old type with solid ends. Kim made as to
scratch<br>
 in his bosom, and thereby lifted his own amulet. The Mahratta's
face<br>
 changed altogether at the sight, and he disposed the amulet
fairly on<br>
 his breast.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he went on to the Kamboh, 'I was in haste, and the
cart,<br>
 driven by a bastard, bound its wheel in a water-cut, and besides
the<br>
 harm done to me there was lost a full dish of tarkeean. I was
not a<br>
 Son of the Charm [a lucky man] that day.'</p>

<p>'That was a great loss,' said the Kamboh, withdrawing
interest. His<br>
 experience of Benares had made him suspicious.</p>

<p>'Who cooked it?' said Kim.</p>

<p>'A woman.' The Mahratta raised his eyes.</p>

<p>'But all women can cook tarkeean,' said the Kamboh. 'It is a
good<br>
 curry, as I know.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, it is a good curry,' said the Mahratta.</p>

<p>'And cheap,' said Kim. 'But what about caste?'</p>

<p>'Oh, there is no caste where men go to - look for tarkeean,'
the<br>
 Mahratta replied, in the prescribed cadence. 'Of whose service
art<br>
 thou?'</p>

<p>'Of the service of this Holy One.' Kim pointed to the happy,
drowsy<br>
 lama, who woke with a jerk at the well-loved word.</p>

<p>'Ah, he was sent from Heaven to aid me. He is called the
Friend of<br>
 all the World. He is also called the Friend of the Stars. He
walks<br>
 as a physician - his time being ripe. Great is his wisdom.'</p>

<p>'And a Son of the Charm,' said Kim under his breath, as the
Kamboh<br>
 made haste to prepare a pipe lest the Mahratta should beg.</p>

<p>'And who is that?' the Mahratta asked, glancing sideways
nervously.</p>

<p>'One whose child I - we have cured, who lies under great debt
to us.<br>
 Sit by the window, man from Jullundur. Here is a sick one.'</p>

<p>'Humph! I have no desire to mix with chance-met wastrels. My
ears<br>
 are not long. I am not a woman wishing to overhear secrets.' The
Jat<br>
 slid himself heavily into a far corner.</p>

<p>'Art thou anything of a healer? I am ten leagues deep in
calamity,'<br>
 cried the Mahratta, picking up the cue.</p>

<p>'This man is cut and bruised all over. I go about to cure
him,' Kim<br>
 retorted. 'None interfered between thy babe and me.'</p>

<p>'I am rebuked,' said the Kamboh meekly. 'I am thy debtor for
the<br>
 life of my son. Thou art a miracle-worker - I know it.'</p>

<p>'Show me the cuts.' Kim bent over the Mahratta's neck, his
heart<br>
 nearly choking him; for this was the Great Game with a
vengeance.<br>
 'Now, tell thy tale swiftly, brother, while I say a charm.'</p>

<p>'I come from the South, where my work lay. One of us they slew
by<br>
 the roadside. Hast thou heard?' Kim shook his head. He, of
course,<br>
 knew nothing of E's predecessor, slain down South in the habit
of an<br>
 Arab trader. 'Having found a certain letter which I was sent
to<br>
 seek, I came away. I escaped from the city and ran to Mhow. So
sure<br>
 was I that none knew, I did not change my face. At Mhow a
woman<br>
 brought charge against me of theft of jewellery in that city
which I<br>
 had left. Then I saw the cry was out against me. I ran from Mhow
by<br>
 night, bribing the police, who had been bribed to hand me
over<br>
 without question to my enemies in the South. Then I lay in
old<br>
 Chitor city a week, a penitent in a temple, but I could not get
rid<br>
 of the letter which was my charge. I buried it under the
Queen's<br>
 Stone, at Chitor, in the place known to us all.'</p>

<p>Kim did not know, but not for worlds would he have broken
the<br>
 thread.</p>

<p>'At Chitor, look you, I was all in Kings' country; for Kotah
to the<br>
 east is beyond the Queen's law, and east again lie Jaipur
and<br>
 Gwalior. Neither love spies, and there is no justice. I was
hunted<br>
 like a wet jackal; but I broke through at Bandakui, where I
heard<br>
 there was a charge against me of murder in the city I had left -
of<br>
 the murder of a boy. They have both the corpse and the
witnesses<br>
 waiting.'</p>

<p>'But cannot the Government protect?'</p>

<p>'We of the Game are beyond protection. If we die, we die. Our
names<br>
 are blotted from the book. That is all. At Bandakui, where lives
one<br>
 of Us, I thought to slip the scent by changing my face, and so
made<br>
 me a Mahratta. Then I came to Agra, and would have turned back
to<br>
 Chitor to recover the letter. So sure I was I had slipped
them.<br>
 Therefore I did not send a tar [telegram] to any one saying
where<br>
 the letter lay. I wished the credit of it all.'</p>

<p>Kim nodded. He understood that feeling well.</p>

<p>'But at Agra, walking in the streets, a man cried a debt
against me,<br>
 and approaching with many witnesses, would hale me to the
courts<br>
 then and there. Oh, they are clever in the South! He recognized
me<br>
 as his agent for cotton. May he burn in Hell for it!'</p>

<p>'And wast thou?'</p>

<p>'O fool! I was the man they sought for the matter of the
letter! I<br>
 ran into the Fleshers' Ward and came out by the House of the
Jew,<br>
 who feared a riot and pushed me forth. I came afoot to Somna
Road -<br>
 I had only money for my tikkut to Delhi - and there, while I lay
in<br>
 a ditch with a fever, one sprang out of the bushes and beat me
and<br>
 cut me and searched me from head to foot. Within earshot of the
te-<br>
 rain it was!'</p>

<p>'Why did he not slay thee out of hand?'</p>

<p>'They are not so foolish. If I am taken in Delhi at the
instance of<br>
 lawyers, upon a proven charge of murder, my body is handed over
to<br>
 the State that desires it. I go back guarded, and then - I
die<br>
 slowly for an example to the rest of Us. The South is not my<br>
 country. I run in circles - like a goat with one eye. I have
not<br>
 eaten for two days. I am marked' - he touched the filthy bandage
on<br>
 his leg - 'so that they will know me at Delhi.'</p>

<p>'Thou art safe in the te-rain, at least.'</p>

<p>'Live a year at the Great Game and tell me that again! The
wires<br>
 will be out against me at Delhi, describing every tear and rag
upon<br>
 me. Twenty - a hundred, if need be - will have seen me slay
that<br>
 boy. And thou art useless!'</p>

<p>Kim knew enough of native methods of attack not to doubt that
the<br>
 case would be deadly complete - even to the corpse. The
Mahratta<br>
 twitched his fingers with pain from time to time. The Kamboh in
his<br>
 corner glared sullenly; the lama was busy over his beads; and
Kim,<br>
 fumbling doctor-fashion at the man's neck, thought out his
plan<br>
 between invocations.</p>

<p>'Hast thou a charm to change my shape? Else I am dead. Five -
ten<br>
 minutes alone, if I had not been so pressed, and I might -'</p>

<p>'Is he cured yet, miracle-worker?' said the Kamboh jealously.
'Thou<br>
 hast chanted long enough.'</p>

<p>'Nay. There is no cure for his hurts, as I see, except he sit
for<br>
 three days in the habit of a bairagi.' This is a common
penance,<br>
 often imposed on a fat trader by his spiritual teacher.</p>

<p>'One priest always goes about to make another priest,' was
the<br>
 retort. Like most grossly superstitious folk, the Kamboh could
not<br>
 keep his tongue from deriding his Church.</p>

<p>'Will thy son be a priest, then? It is time he took more of
my<br>
 quinine.'</p>

<p>'We Jats are all buffaloes,' said the Kamboh, softening
anew.</p>

<p>Kim rubbed a finger-tip of bitterness on the child's trusting
little<br>
 lips. 'I have asked for nothing,' he said sternly to the
father,<br>
 'except food. Dost thou grudge me that? I go to heal another
man.<br>
 Have I thy leave - Prince?'</p>

<p>Up flew the man's huge paws in supplication. 'Nay - nay. Do
not mock<br>
 me thus.'</p>

<p>'It pleases me to cure this sick one. Thou shalt acquire merit
by<br>
 aiding. What colour ash is there in thy pipe-bowl? White. That
is<br>
 auspicious. Was there raw turmeric among thy foodstuffs?'</p>

<p>'I - I -'</p>

<p>'Open thy bundle!'</p>

<p>It was the usual collection of small oddments: bits of cloth,
quack<br>
 medicines, cheap fairings, a clothful of atta - greyish,
rough-<br>
 ground native flour - twists of down-country tobacco, tawdry
pipe-<br>
 stems, and a packet of curry-stuff, all wrapped in. a quilt.
Kim<br>
 turned it over with the air of a wise warlock, muttering a<br>
 Mohammedan invocation.</p>

<p>'This is wisdom I learned from the Sahibs,' he whispered to
the<br>
 lama; and here, when one thinks of his training at Lurgan's,
he<br>
 spoke no more than the truth. 'There is a great evil in this
man's<br>
 fortune, as shown by the Stars, which - which troubles him.
Shall I<br>
 take it away?'</p>

<p>'Friend of the Stars, thou hast done well in all things. Let
it be<br>
 at thy pleasure. Is it another healing?'</p>

<p>'Quick! Be quick!' gasped the Mahratta. 'The train may
stop.'</p>

<p>'A healing against the shadow of death,' said Kim, mixing
the<br>
 Kamboh's flour with the mingled charcoal and tobacco ash in the
red-<br>
 earth bowl of the pipe. E, without a word, slipped off his
turban<br>
 and shook down his long black hair.</p>

<p><br>
 'That is my food - priest,' the jat growled.</p>

<p>'A buffalo in the temple! Hast thou dared to look even thus
far?'<br>
 said Kim. 'I must do mysteries before fools; but have a care
for<br>
 thine eyes. Is there a film before them already? I save the
babe,<br>
 and for return thou - oh, shameless!' The man flinched at the
direct<br>
 gaze, for Kim was wholly in earnest.</p>

<p>'Shall I curse thee, or shall I -' He picked up the outer
cloth of<br>
 the bundle and threw it over the bowed head. 'Dare so much as
to<br>
 think a wish to see, and - and - even I cannot save thee.
Sit!</p>

<p>Be dumb!'</p>

<p>'I am blind - dumb. Forbear to curse! Co - come, child; we
will<br>
 play a game of hiding. Do not, for my sake, look from under
the<br>
 cloth.'</p>

<p>'I see hope,' said E23. 'What is thy scheme?'</p>

<p>'This comes next,' said Kim, plucking the thin body-shirt.
E23<br>
 hesitated, with all a North-West man's dislike of baring his
body.</p>

<p>'What is caste to a cut throat?' said Kim, rending it to the
waist.<br>
 'We must make thee a yellow Saddhu all over. Strip - strip<br>
 swiftly, and shake thy hair over thine eyes while I scatter the
ash.<br>
 Now, a caste-mark on thy forehead.' He drew from his bosom
the<br>
 little Survey paint-box and a cake of crimson lake.</p>

<p>'Art thou only a beginner?' said E23, labouring literally for
the<br>
 dear life, as he slid out of his body-wrappings and stood clear
in<br>
 the loin-cloth while Kim splashed in a noble caste-mark on the
ash-<br>
 smeared brow.</p>

<p>'But two days entered to the Game, brother,' Kim replied.
'Smear<br>
 more ash on the bosom.'</p>

<p>'Hast thou met - a physician of sick pearls?' He switched out
his<br>
 long, tight-rolled turban-cloth and, with swiftest hands, rolled
it<br>
 over and under about his loins into the intricate devices of
a<br>
 Saddhu's cincture.</p>

<p>'Hah! Dost thou know his touch, then? He was my teacher for
a<br>
 while. We must bar thy legs. Ash cures wounds. Smear it
again.'</p>

<p>'I was his pride once, but thou art almost better. The Gods
are<br>
 kind to us! Give me that.'</p>

<p>It was a tin box of opium pills among the rubbish of the
Jat's<br>
 bundle. E23 gulped down a half handful. 'They are good
against<br>
 hunger, fear, and chill. And they make the eyes red too,' he<br>
 explained. 'Now I shall have heart to play the Game. We lack
only<br>
 a Saddhu's tongs. What of the old clothes?'</p>

<p>Kim rolled them small, and stuffed them into the slack folds
of his<br>
 tunic. With a yellow-ochre paint cake he smeared the legs and
the<br>
 breast, great streaks against the background of flour, ash,
and<br>
 turmeric.</p>

<p>'The blood on them is enough to hang thee, brother.'</p>

<p>'Maybe; but no need to throw them out of the window ... It
is<br>
 finished.' His voice thrilled with a boy's pure delight in the
Game.<br>
 'Turn and look, O jat!'</p>

<p>'The Gods protect us,' said the hooded Kamboh, emerging like
a<br>
 buffalo from the reeds. 'But - whither went the Mahratta? What
hast<br>
 thou done?'</p>

<p>Kim had been trained by Lurgan Sahib; E23, by virtue of
his<br>
 business, was no bad actor. In place of the tremulous,
shrinking<br>
 trader there lolled against the corner an all but naked,
ash-<br>
 smeared, ochre-barred, dusty-haired Saddhu, his swollen eyes -
opium<br>
 takes quick effect on an empty stomach - luminous with insolence
and<br>
 bestial lust, his legs crossed under him, Kim's brown rosary
round<br>
 his neck, and a scant yard of worn, flowered chintz on his<br>
 shoulders. The child buried his face in his amazed father's
arms.</p>

<p>'Look up, Princeling! We travel with warlocks, but they will
not<br>
 hurt thee. Oh, do not cry ... What is the sense of curing a
child<br>
 one day and killing him with fright the next?'</p>

<p>'The child will be fortunate all his life. He has seen a
great<br>
 healing. When I was a child I made clay men and horses.'</p>

<p>'I have made them too. Sir Banas, he comes in the night and
makes<br>
 them all alive at the back of our kitchen-midden,' piped the
child.</p>

<p>'And so thou art not frightened at anything. Eh, Prince?'</p>

<p>'I was frightened because my father was frightened. I felt his
arms<br>
 shake.'</p>

<p>'Oh, chicken-man!' said Kim, and even the abashed Jat laughed.
'I<br>
 have done a healing on this poor trader. He must forsake his
gains<br>
 and his account-books, and sit by the wayside three nights
to<br>
 overcome the malignity of his enemies. The Stars are against
him.'</p>

<p>'The fewer money-lenders the better, say I; but, Saddhu or
no<br>
 Saddhu, he should pay for my stuff on his shoulders.'</p>

<p>'So? But that is thy child on thy shoulder - given over to
the<br>
 burning-ghat not two days ago. There remains one thing more. I
did<br>
 this charm in thy presence because need was great.I changed
his<br>
 shape and his soul. None the less, if, by any chance, O man
from<br>
 Jullundur, thou rememberest what thou hast seen, either among
the<br>
 elders sitting under the village tree, or in thine own house, or
in<br>
 company of thy priest when he blesses thy cattle, a murrain
will<br>
 come among the buffaloes, and a fire in thy thatch, and rats in
the<br>
 corn-bins, and the curse of our Gods upon thy fields that they
may<br>
 be barren before thy feet and after thy ploughshare.' This was
part<br>
 of an old curse picked up from a fakir by the Taksali Gate in
the<br>
 days of Kim's innocence. It lost nothing by repetition.</p>

<p>'Cease, Holy One! In mercy, cease!' cried the Jat. 'Do not
curse<br>
 the household. I saw nothing! I heard nothing! I am thy cow!'
and<br>
 he made to grab at Kim's bare foot beating rhythmically on
the<br>
 carriage floor. 'But since thou hast been permitted to aid me in
the<br>
 matter of a pinch of flour and a little opium and such trifles
as I<br>
 have honoured by using in my art, so will the Gods return a<br>
 blessing,' and he gave it at length, to the man's immense
relief. It<br>
 was one that he had learned from Lurgan Sahib.</p>

<p><br>
 The lama stared through his spectacles as he had not stared at
the<br>
 business of disguisement. 'Friend of the Stars,' he said at
last,<br>
 'thou hast acquired great wisdom. Beware that it do not give
birth<br>
 to pride. No man having the Law before his eyes speaks hastily
of<br>
 any matter which he has seen or encountered.'</p>

<p>'No - no - no, indeed,' cried the farmer, fearful lest the
master<br>
 should be minded to improve on the pupil. E23, with relaxed
mouth,<br>
 gave himself up to the opium that is meat, tobacco, and medicine
to<br>
 the spent Asiatic.</p>

<p>So, in a silence of awe and great miscomprehension, they slid
into<br>
 Delhi about lamp-lighting time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><br>
 Who hath desired the Sea - the sight of salt-water
unbounded?<br>
 The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the
comber<br>
 wind-hounded?<br>
 The sleek-barrelled swell before storm - grey, foamless,
enormous,<br>

 Stark calm on the lap of the Line - or the crazy-eyed
hurricane<br>
 blowing?<br>
 His Sea in no showing the same - his Sea and the same 'neath
all<br>
 showing -<br>
 His Sea that his being fulfils?<br>
 So and no otherwise - so and no otherwise hill-men desire
their<br>
 Hills!</p>

<p>The Sea and the Hills.</p>

<p>'I have found my heart again,' said E23, under cover of
the<br>
 platform's tumult. 'Hunger and fear make men dazed, or I might
have<br>
 thought of this escape before. I was right. They come to hunt
for<br>
 me. Thou hast saved my head.'</p>

<p>A group of yellow-trousered Punjab policemen, headed by a hot
and<br>
 perspiring young Englishman, parted the crowd about the
carriages.<br>
 Behind them, inconspicuous as a cat, ambled a small fat person
who<br>
 looked like a lawyer's tout.</p>

<p><br>
 'See the young Sahib reading from a paper. My description is in
his<br>
 hand,' said E23. 'Thev go carriage by carriage, like
fisher-folk<br>
 netting a pool.'</p>

<p>When the procession reached their compartment, E23 was
counting his<br>
 beads with a steady jerk of the wrist; while Kim jeered at him
for<br>
 being so drugged as to have lost the ringed fire-tongs which are
the<br>
 Saddhu's distinguishing mark. The lama, deep in meditation,
stared<br>
 straight before him; and the farmer, glancing furtively,
gathered up<br>
 his belongings.</p>

<p>'Nothing here but a parcel of holy-bolies,' said the
Englishman<br>
 aloud, and passed on amid a ripple of uneasiness; for native
police<br>
 mean extortion to the native all India over.</p>

<p>'The trouble now, ' whispered E23, 'lies in sending a wire as
to the<br>
 place where I hid that letter I was sent to find. I cannot go to
the<br>
 tar-office in this guise.'</p>

<p>'Is it not enough I have saved thy neck?'</p>

<p>'Not if the work be left unfinished. Did never the healer of
sick<br>
 pearls tell thee so? Comes another Sahib! Ah!'</p>

<p>This was a tallish, sallowish District Superintendent of
Police -<br>
 belt, helmet, polished spurs and all - strutting and twirling
his<br>
 dark moustache.</p>

<p>'What fools are these Police Sahibs!' said Kim genially.</p>

<p>E23 glanced up under his eyelids. 'It is well said,' he
muttered in<br>
 a changed voice. 'I go to drink water. Keep my place.'</p>

<p>He blundered out almost into the Englishman's arms, and was
bad-<br>
 worded in clumsy Urdu.</p>

<p>'Tum mut? You drunk? You mustn't bang about as though
Delhi<br>
 station belonged to you, my friend.'</p>

<p>E23, not moving a muscle of his countenance, answered with a
stream<br>
 of the filthiest abuse, at which Kim naturally rejoiced. It
reminded<br>
 him of the drummer-boys and the barrack- sweepers at Umballa in
the<br>
 terrible time of his first schooling.</p>

<p>'My good fool,' the Englishman drawled. 'Nickle-jao! Go back
to<br>
 your carriage.'</p>

<p>Step by step, withdrawing deferentially and dropping his
voice, the<br>
 yellow Saddhu clomb back to the carriage, cursing the D.S.P.
to<br>
 remotest posterity, by - here Kim almost jumped - by the curse
of<br>
 the Queen's Stone, by the writing under the Queen's Stone, and
by an<br>
 assortment of Gods "with wholly, new names.</p>

<p>'I don't know what you're saving,' - the Englishman flushed
angrily<br>
 - 'but it's some piece of blasted impertinence. Come out of
that!'</p>

<p>E23, affecting to misunderstand, gravely produced his ticket,
which<br>
 the Englishman wrenched angrily from his hand.</p>

<p>'Oh, zoolum! What oppression!' growled the Jat from his
corner.<br>
 'All for the sake of a jest too.' He had been grinning at
the<br>
 freedom of the Saddhu's tongue. 'Thy charms do not work well
today,<br>
 Holy One!'</p>

<p>The Saddhu followed the policeman, fawning and supplicating.
The<br>
 ruck of passengers, busy, with their babies andtheir bundles,
had<br>
 not noticed the affair. Kim slipped outbehind him; for it
flashed<br>
 through his head that he had heardthis angry, stupid Sahib<br>
 discoursing loud personalities to an oldlady near Umballa
three<br>
 years ago.</p>

<p>'It is well', the Saddhu whispered, jammed in the calling,<br>
 shouting, bewildered press - a Persian greyhound between his
feet<br>
 and a cageful of yelling hawks under charge of a Rajput falconer
in<br>
 the small of his back. 'He has gone now to send word of the
letter<br>
 which I hid. Thev told me he was in Peshawur. I might have
known<br>
 that he is like the crocodile - always at the other ford. He
has<br>
 saved me from present calamity, but I owe my life to thee.'</p>

<p>'Is he also one of Us?' Kim ducked under a Mewar
camel-driver's<br>
 greasy armpit and cannoned off a covey of jabbering Sikh
matrons.</p>

<p>'Not less than the greatest. We are both fortunate! I will
make<br>
 report to him of what thou hast done. I am safe under his<br>
 protection.'</p>

<p>He bored through the edge of the crowd besieging the
carriages, and<br>
 squatted by the bench near the telegraph-office.</p>

<p>'Return, or they take thy place! Have no fear for the work,
brother<br>
 - or my life. Thou hast given me breathing-space, and
Strickland<br>
 Sahib has pulled me to land. We may work together at the Game
yet.<br>
 Farewell!'</p>

<p>Kim hurried to his carriage: elated, bewildered, but a
little<br>
 nettled in that he had no key to the secrets about him.</p>

<p>'I am only a beginner at the Game, that is sure. I could not
have<br>
 leaped into safety as did the Saddhu. He knew it was darkest
under<br>
 the lamp. I could not have thought to tell news under pretence
of<br>
 cursing ... and how clever was the Sahib! No matter, I savcd
the<br>
 life of one ... Where is the Kamboh gone, Holy One?' he
whispered,<br>
 as he took his seat in the now crowded compartment.</p>

<p>'A fear gripped him,' the lama replied, with a touch of
tender<br>
 malice. 'He saw thee change the Mahratta to a Saddhu in the<br>
 twinkling of an eye, as a protection against evil. That shook
him.<br>
 Then he saw the Saddhu fall sheer into the hands of the polis -
all<br>
 the effect of thy art. Then he gathered up his son and fled; for
he<br>
 said that thou didst change a quiet trader into an impudent
bandier<br>
 of words with the Sahibs, and he feared a like fate. Where is
the<br>
 Saddhu?'</p>

<p>'With the polis,' said Kim . . . 'Yet I saved the Kamboh's
child.'</p>

<p>The lama snuffed blandly.</p>

<p>'Ah, chela, see how thou art overtaken! Thou didst cure
the<br>
 Kamboh's child solely to acquire merit. But thou didst put a
spell<br>
 on the Mahratta with prideful workings - I watched thee - and
with<br>
 sidelong glances to bewilder an old old man and a foolish
farmer:<br>
 whence calamity and suspicion.'</p>

<p>Kim controlled himself with an effort beyond his years. Not
more<br>
 than any other youngster did he like to eat dirt or to be
misjudged,<br>
 but he saw himself in a cleft stick. The train rolled out of
Delhi<br>
 into the night.</p>

<p>'It is true,' he murmured. 'Where I have offended thee I have
done<br>
 wrong.'</p>

<p>'It is more, chela. Thou hast loosed an Act upon the world,
and as<br>
 a stone thrown into a pool so spread the consequences thou canst
not<br>
 tell how far.'</p>

<p>This ignorance was well both for Kim's vanity and for the
lama's<br>
 peace of mind, when we think that there was then being handed in
at<br>
 Simla a code-wire reporting the arrival of E23 at Delhi, and,
more<br>
 important, the whereabouts of a letter he had been commissioned
to -<br>
 abstract. Incidentally, an over-zealous policeman had arrested,
on<br>
 charge of murder done in a far southern State, a horribly
indignant<br>
 Ajmir cotton-broker, who was explaining himself to a Mr
Strickland<br>
 on Delhi platform, while E23 was paddling through byways into
the<br>
 locked heart of Delhi city. In two hours several telegrams
had<br>
 reached the angry minister of a southern State reporting that
all<br>
 trace of a somewhat bruised Mahratta had been lost; and by the
time<br>
 the leisurely train halted at Saharunpore the last ripple of
the<br>
 store Kim had helped to heave was lapping against the steps of
a<br>
 mosque in far-away Roum - where it disturbed a pious man at
prayers.</p>

<p>The lama made his in ample form near the dewy
bougainvillea-trellis<br>
 near the platform, cheered by the clear sunshine and the
presence of<br>
 his disciple. 'We will put these things behind us,' he said,<br>
 indicating the brazen engine and the gleaming track. 'The
jolting of<br>
 the te-rain - though a wonderful thing - has turned my bones
to<br>
 water. We will use clean air henceforward.'</p>

<p>'Let us go to the Kulu woman's house' said Kim, and stepped
forth<br>
 cheerily under the bundles. Early morning Saharunpore-way is
clean<br>
 and well scented. He thought of the other mornings at St
Xavier's,<br>
 and it topped his already thrice-heaped contentment.</p>

<p>'Where is this new haste born from? Wise men do not run about
like<br>
 chickens in the sun. We have come hundreds upon hundreds of
koss<br>
 already, and, till now, I have scarcely been alone with thee
an<br>
 instant. How canst thou receive instruction all jostled of
crowds?<br>
 How can I, whelmed by a flux of talk, meditate upon the
Way?'</p>

<p>'Her tongue grows no shorter with the years, then?' the
disciple<br>
 smiled.</p>

<p>'Nor her desire for charms. I remember once when I spoke of
the<br>
 Wheel of Life' - the lama fumbled in his bosom for his latest
copy -<br>
 'she was only curious about the devils that besiege children.
She<br>
 shall acquire merit by entertaining us - in a little while - at
an<br>
 after-occasion - softly, softly. Now we will wander
loose-foot,<br>
 waiting upon the Chain of Things. The Search is sure.'</p>

<p>So they travelled very easily across and among the broad
bloomful<br>
 fruit-gardens - by way of Aminabad, Sahaigunge, Akrola of the
Ford,<br>
 and little Phulesa - the line of the Siwaliks always to the
north,<br>
 and behind them again the snows. After long, sweet sleep under
the<br>
 dry stars came the lordly, leisurely passage through a
waking<br>
 village - begging-bowl held forth in silence, but eyes roving
in<br>
 defiance of the Law from sky's edge to sky's edge. Then would
Kim<br>
 return soft-footed through the soft dust to his master under
the<br>
 shadow of a mango-tree or the thinner shade of a white Doon
siris,<br>
 to eat and drink at ease. At mid-day, after talk and a
little<br>
 wayfaring, they slept; meeting the world refreshed when the air
was<br>
 cooler. Night found them adventuring into new territory -
some<br>
 chosen village spied three hours before across the fat land,
and<br>
 much discussed upon the road.</p>

<p>There they told their tale - a new one each evening so far as
Kim<br>
 was concerned - and there were they made welcome, either by
priest<br>
 or headman, after the custom of the kindly East.</p>

<p>When the shadows shortened and the lama leaned more heavily
upon<br>
 Kim, there was always the Wheel of Life to draw forth, to hold
flat<br>
 under wiped stones, and with a long straw to expound cycle by
cycle.<br>
 Here sat the Gods on high - and they were dreams of dreams. Here
was<br>
 our Heaven and the world of the demi-Gods - horsemen fighting
among<br>
 the hills. Here were the agonies done upon the beasts, souls<br>
 ascending or descending the ladder and therefore not to be<br>
 interfered with. Here were the Hells, hot and cold, and the
abodes<br>
 of tormented ghosts. Let the chela study the troubles that come
from<br>
 over-eating - bloated stomach and burning bowels. Obediently,
then,<br>
 with bowed head and brown finger alert to follow the pointer,
did<br>
 the chela study; but when they came to the Human World, busy
and<br>
 profitless, that is just above the Hells, his mind was
distracted;<br>
 for by the roadside trundled the very Wheel itself, eating,<br>
 drinking, trading, marrying, and quarrelling - all warmly
alive.<br>
 Often the lama made the living pictures the matter of his
text,<br>
 bidding Kim - too ready - note how the flesh takes a
thousand<br>
 shapes, desirable or detestable as men reckon, but in truth of
no<br>
 account either way; and how the stupid spirit, bond-slave to
the<br>
 Hog, the Dove, and the Serpent - lusting after betel-nut, a new
yoke<br>
 of oxen, women, or the favour of kings - is bound to follow the
body<br>
 through all the Heavens and all the Hells, and strictly round
again.<br>
 Sometimes a woman or a poor man, watching the ritual - it
was<br>
 nothing less - when the great yellow chart was unfolded, would
throw<br>
 a few flowers or a handful of cowries upon its edge. It
sufficed<br>
 these humble ones that they had met a Holy One who might be
moved to<br>
 remember them in his prayers.</p>

<p>'Cure them if they are sick,' said the lama, when Kim's
sporting<br>
 instincts woke. 'Cure them if they have fever, but by no means
work<br>
 charms. Remember what befell the Mahratta.'</p>

<p>'Then all Doing is evil?' Kim replied, lying out under a big
tree at<br>
 the fork of the Doon road, watching the little ants run over
his<br>
 hand.</p>

<p>'To abstain from action is well - except to acquire
merit.'</p>

<p>'At the Gates of Learning we were taught that to abstain from
action<br>
 was unbefitting a Sahib. And I am a Sahib.'</p>

<p>'Friend of all the World,' - the lama looked directly at Kim -
'I am<br>
 an old man - pleased with shows as are children. To those
who<br>
 follow the Way there is neither black nor white, Hind nor
Bhotiyal.<br>
 We be all souls seeking escape. No matter what thy wisdom
learned<br>
 among Sahibs, when we come to my River thou wilt be freed from
all<br>
 illusion - at my side. Hai! My bones ache for that River, as
they<br>
 ached in the te-rain; but my spirit sits above my bones,
waiting.<br>
 The Search is sure!'</p>

<p>'I am answered. Is it permitted to ask a question?'</p>

<p>The lama inclined his stately head.</p>

<p>'I ate thy bread for three years - as thou knowest. Holy
One,<br>
 whence came -?'</p>

<p>'There is much wealth, as men count it, in Bhotiyal,' the
lama<br>
 returned with composure. 'In my own place I have the illusion
of<br>
 honour. I ask for that I need. I am not concerned with the
account.<br>
 That is for my monastery. Ai! The black high seats in the<br>
 monastery, and novices all in order!'</p>

<p>And he told stories, tracing with a finger in the dust, of
the<br>
 immense and sumptuous ritual of avalanche-guarded cathedrals;
of<br>
 processions and devil-dances; of the changing of monks and nuns
into<br>
 swine; of holy cities fifteen thousand feet in the air; of
intrigue<br>
 between monastery and monastery; of voices among the hills, and
of<br>
 that mysterious mirage that dances on dry snow. He spoke even
of<br>
 Lhassa and of the Dalai Lama, whom he had seen and adored.</p>

<p>Each long, perfect day rose behind Kim for a barrier to cut
him off<br>
 from his race and his mother-tongue. He slipped back to
thinking<br>
 and dreaming in the vernacular, and mechanically followed the
lama's<br>
 ceremonial observances at eating, drinking, and the like. The
old<br>
 man's mind turned more and more to his monastery as his eyes
turned<br>
 to the steadfast snows. His River troubled him nothing. Now
and<br>
 again, indeed, he would gaze long and long at a tuft or a
twig,<br>
 expecting, he said, the earth to cleave and deliver its
blessing;<br>
 but he was content to be with his disciple, at ease in the
temperate<br>
 wind that comes down from the Doon. This was not Ceylon, nor
Buddh<br>
 Gaya, nor Bombay, nor some grass-tangled ruins that he seemed
to<br>
 have stumbled upon two years ago. He spoke of those places as
a<br>
 scholar removed from vanity, as a Seeker walking in humility, as
an<br>
 old man, wise and temperate, illumining knowledge with
brilliant<br>
 insight. Bit by bit, disconnectedly, each tale called up by
some<br>
 wayside thing, he spoke of all his wanderings up and down Hind;
till<br>
 Kim, who had loved him without reason, now loved him for fifty
good<br>
 reasons. So they enjoyed themselves in high felicity,
abstaining,<br>
 as the Rule demands, from evil words, covetous desires; not
over-<br>
 eating, not lying on high beds, nor wearing rich clothes.
Their<br>
 stomachs told them the time, and the people brought them their
food,<br>
 as the saying is. They were lords of the villages of
Aminabad,<br>
 Sahaigunge, Akrola of the Ford, and little Phulesa, where Kim
gave<br>
 the soulless woman a blessing.</p>

<p>But news travels fast in India, and too soon shuffled across
the<br>
 crop-land, bearing a basket of fruits with a box of Kabul grapes
and<br>
 gilt oranges, a white-whiskered servitor - a lean, dry Oorya
-<br>
 begging them to bring the honour of their presence to his
mistress,<br>
 distressed in her mind that the lama had neglected her so
long.</p>

<p>'Now do I remember' - the lama spoke as though it were a
wholly new<br>
 proposition. 'She is virtuous, but an inordinate talker.'</p>

<p>Kim was sitting on the edge of a cow's manger, telling stories
to a<br>
 village smith's children.</p>

<p>'She will only ask for another son for her daughter. I have
not<br>
 forgotten her,' he said. 'Let her acquire merit. Send word that
we<br>
 will come.'</p>

<p>They covered eleven miles through the fields in two days, and
were<br>
 overwhelmed with attentions at the end; for the old lady held a
fine<br>
 tradition of hospitality, to which she forced her son-in-law,
who<br>
 was under the thumb of his women-folk and bought peace by
borrowing<br>
 of the money-lender. Age had not weakened her tongue or her
memory,<br>
 and from a discreetly barred upper window, in the hearing of
not<br>
 less than a dozen servants, she paid Kim compliments that would
have<br>
 flung European audiences into unclean dismay.</p>

<p>'But thou art still the shameless beggar-brat of the parao,'
she<br>
 shrilled. 'I have not forgotten thee. Wash ye and eat. The
father of<br>
 my daughter's son is gone away awhile. So we poor women are dumb
and<br>
 useless.'</p>

<p>For proof, she harangued the entire household unsparingly till
food<br>
 and drink were brought; and in the evening - the
smoke-scented<br>
 evening, copper-dun and turquoise across the fields - it pleased
her<br>
 to order her palanquin to be set down in the untidy forecourt
by<br>
 smoky torchlight; and there, behind not too closely drawn
curtains,<br>
 she gossiped.</p>

<p>'Had the Holy One come alone, I should have received him
otherwise;<br>
 but with this rogue, who can be too careful?'</p>

<p>'Maharanee,' said Kim, choosing as always the amplest title,
'is it<br>
 my fault that none other than a Sahib - a polis-Sahib - called
the<br>
 Maharanee whose face he -' 'Chutt! That was on the
pilgrimage.<br>
 When we travel - thou knowest the proverb.'</p>

<p>'Called the Maharanee a Breaker of Hearts and a Dispenser
of<br>
 Delights?'</p>

<p>'To remember that! It was true. So he did. That was in the
time of<br>
 the bloom of my beauty.' She chuckled like a contented parrot
above<br>
 the sugar lump. 'Now tell me of thy goings and comings - as much
as<br>
 may be without shame. How many maids, and whose wives, hang
upon<br>
 thine eyelashes? Ye hail from Benares? I would have gone there
again<br>
 this year, but my daughter - we have only two sons. Phaii! Such
is<br>
 the effect of these low plains. Now in Kulu men are elephants.
But I<br>
 would ask thy Holy One - stand aside, rogue - a charm against
most<br>
 lamentable windy colics that in mango-time overtake my
daughter's<br>
 eldest. Two years back he gave me a powerful spell.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Holy One!' said Kim, bubbling with mirth at the lama's
rueful<br>
 face.</p>

<p>'It is true. I gave her one against wind.'</p>

<p>'Teeth - teeth - teeth, ' snapped the old woman.</p>

<p>"'Cure them if they are sick,"' Kim quoted relishingly, "'but
by no<br>
 means work charms. Remember what befell the Mahratta."'</p>

<p>'That was two Rains ago; she wearied me with her continual<br>
 importunity.' The lama groaned as the Unjust judge had
groaned<br>
 before him. 'Thus it comes - take note, my chela - that even
those<br>
 who would follow the Way are thrust aside by idle women. Three
days<br>
 through, when the child was sick, she talked to me.'</p>

<p>'Arre! 1 6and to whom else should I talk? The boy's mother
knew<br>
 nothing, and the father - in the nights of the cold weather it
was -<br>
 "Pray to the Gods," said he, forsooth, and turning over,
snored!'</p>

<p>'I gave her the charm. What is an old man to do?'</p>

<p>"'To abstain from action is well - except to acquire
merit."'</p>

<p>'Ah chela, if thou desertest me, I am all alone.'</p>

<p>'He found his milk-teeth easily at any rate,' said the old
lady.<br>
 'But all priests are alike.'</p>

<p>Kim coughed severely. Being young, he did not approve of
her<br>
 flippancy. 'To importune the wise out of season is to invite<br>
 calamitv.'</p>

<p>'There is a talking mynah' - the thrust came back with the
well-<br>
 remembered snap of the jewelled fore-finger - 'over the
stables<br>
 which has picked up the very tone of the family priest. Maybe
I<br>
 forget honour to my guests, but if ye had seen him double his
fists<br>
 into his belly, which was like a half-grown gourd, and cry:
"Here is<br>
 the pain!" ye would forgive. I am half minded to take the
hakim's<br>
 medicine. He sells it cheap, and certainly it makes him fat
as<br>
 Shiv's own bull. He does not deny remedies, but I doubted for
the<br>
 child because of the in-auspicious colour of the bottles.'</p>

<p>The lama, under cover of the monologue, had faded out into
the<br>
 darkness towards the room prepared.</p>

<br>
'Thou hast angered him, belike,' said Kim.

<p>'Not he. He is wearied, and I forgot, being a grandmother.
(None<br>
 but a grandmother should ever oversee a child. Mothers are only
fit<br>
 for bearing.) Tomorrow, when he sees how my daughter's son is
grown,<br>
 he will write the charm. Then, too, he can judge of the new
hakim's<br>
 drugs.'</p>

<p>'Who is the hakim, Maharanee?'</p>

<p>'A wanderer, as thou art, but a most sober Bengali from Dacca
- a<br>
 master of medicine. He relieved me of an oppression after meat
by<br>
 means of a small pill that wrought like a devil unchained.
He<br>
 travels about now, vending preparations of great value. He has
even<br>
 papers, printed in Angrezi, telling what things he has done
for<br>
 weak-backed men and slack women. He has been here four days;
but<br>
 hearing ye were coming (hakims and priests are snake and tiger
the<br>
 world over) he has, as I take it, gone to cover.'</p>

<p>While she drew breath after this volley, the ancient
servant,<br>
 sitting unrebuked on the edge of the torchlight, muttered:
'This<br>
 house is a cattle-pound, as it were, for all charlatans and
-<br>
 priests. Let the boy stop eating mangoes ... but who can argue
with<br>
 a grandmother?' He raised his voice respectfully: 'Sahiba, the
hakim<br>
 sleeps after his meat. He is in the quarters behind the
dovecote'</p>

<p>Kim bristled like an expectant terrier. To outface and down-
talk a<br>
 Calcutta-taught Bengali, a voluble Dacca drug-vendor, would be
a<br>
 good game. It was not seemly that the lama, and incidentally<br>
 himself, should be thrown aside for such an one. He knew
those<br>
 curious bastard English advertisements at the backs of
native<br>
 newspapers. St Xavier's boys sometimes brought them in by
stealth to<br>
 snigger over among their mates; for the language of the
grateful<br>
 patient recounting his symptoms is most simple and revealing.
The<br>
 Oorya, not unanxious to play off one parasite against the
other,<br>
 slunk away towards the dovecote</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Kim, with measured scorn. 'Their stock-in-trade is
a<br>
 little coloured water and a very great shamelessness. Their prey
are<br>
 broken-down kings and overfed Bengalis. Their profit is in
children<br>
 - who are not born.' The old lady chuckled. 'Do not be
envious.<br>
 Charms are better, eh? I never gainsaid it. See that thy Holy
One<br>
 writes me a good amulet by the morning.'</p>

<p>'None but the ignorant deny' - a thick, heavy voice boomed
through<br>
 the darkness, as a figure came to rest squatting - 'None but
the<br>
 ignorant deny the value of charms. None but the ignorant deny
the<br>
 value of medicines.'</p>

<p>'A rat found a piece of turmeric. Said he: "I will open a
grocer's<br>
 shop,"' Kim retorted.</p>

<p>Battle was fairly joined now, and they heard the old lady
stiffen to<br>
 attention.</p>

<p>'The priest's son knows the names of his nurse and three Gods.
Says<br>
 he: "Hear me, or I will curse you by the three million Great
Ones."'<br>
 Decidedly this invisible had an arrow or two in his quiver. He
went<br>
 on: 'I am but a teacher of the alphabet. I have learned all
the<br>
 wisdom of the Sahibs.'</p>

<p>'The Sahibs never grow old. They dance and they play like
children<br>
 when they are grandfathers. A strong-backed breed,' piped the
voice<br>
 inside the palanquin.</p>

<p>'I have, too, our drugs which loosen humours of the head in
hot and<br>
 angry men. Sina well compounded when the moon stands in the
proper<br>
 House; yellow earths I have - arplan from China that makes a
man<br>
 renew his youth and astonish his household; saffron from
Kashmir,<br>
 and the best salep of Kabul. Many people have died before -'</p>

<p>'That I surely believe,' said Kim.</p>

<p>'They knew the value of my drugs. I do not give my sick the
mere<br>
 ink in which a charm is written, but hot and rending drugs
which<br>
 descend and wrestle with the evil.'</p>

<p>'Very mightily they do so,' sighed the old lady.</p>

<p>The voice launched into an immense tale of misfortune and<br>
 bankruptcy, studded with plentiful petitions to the Government.
'But<br>
 for my fate, which overrules all, I had been now in
Government<br>
 employ. I bear a degree from the great school at Calcutta -
whither,<br>
 maybe, the son of this House shall go.'</p>

<p>'He shall indeed. If our neighbour's brat can in a few years
be<br>
 made an F A' (First Arts - she used the English word, of which
she<br>
 had heard so often), 'how much more shall children clever as
some<br>
 that I know bear away prizes at rich Calcutta.'</p>

<p>'Never,' said the voice, 'have I seen such a child! Born in
an<br>
 auspicious hour, and - but for that colic which, alas! turning
into<br>
 black cholers, may carry him off like a pigeon - destined to
many<br>
 years, he is enviable.'</p>

<p>'Hai mai!' said the old lady. 'To praise children is
inauspicious,<br>
 or I could listen to this talk. But the back of the house is<br>
 unguarded, and even in this soft air men think themselves to be
men,<br>
 and women we know ... The child's father is away too, and I must
be<br>
 chowkedar [watchman] in my old age. Up! Up! Take up the
palanquin.<br>
 Let the hakim and the young priest settle between them
whether<br>
 charms or medicine most avail. Ho! worthless people, fetch
tobacco<br>
 for the guests, and - round the homestead go I!'</p>

<p>The palanquin reeled off, followed by straggling torches and a
horde<br>
 of dogs. Twenty villages knew the Sahiba - her failings, her
tongue,<br>
 and her large charity. Twenty villages cheated her after
immemorial<br>
 custom, but no man would have stolen or robbed within her<br>
 jurisdiction for any gift under heaven. None the less, she
made<br>
 great parade of her formal inspections, the riot of which could
be<br>
 heard half-way to Mussoorie.</p>

<p>Kim relaxed, as one augur must when he meets another. The
hakim,<br>
 still squatting, slid over his hookah with a friendly foot, and
Kim<br>
 pulled at the good weed. The hangers-on expected grave
professional<br>
 debate, and perhaps a little free doctoring.</p>

<p>'To discuss medicine before the ignorant is of one piece
with<br>
 teaching the peacock to sing,' said the hakim.</p>

<p>'True courtesy,' Kim echoed, 'is very often inattention.'</p>

<p>These, be it understood, were company-manners, designed to
impress.</p>

<p>'Hi! I have an ulcer on my leg,' cried a scullion. 'Look at
it!'</p>

<p>'Get hence! Remove!' said the hakim. 'Is it the habit of the
place<br>
 to pester honoured guests? Ye crowd in like buffaloes.'</p>

<p>'If the Sahiba knew -' Kim began.</p>

<p>'Ai! Ai! Come away. They are meat for our mistress. When her
young<br>
 Shaitan's colics are cured perhaps we poor people may be
suffered to<br>
 -'</p>

<p>'The mistress fed thy wife when thou wast in jail for breaking
the<br>
 money-lender's head. Who speaks against her?' The old
servitor<br>
 curled his white moustaches savagely in the young moonlight. 'I
am<br>
 responsible for the honour of this house. Go!' and he drove
the<br>
 underlings before him.</p>

<p>Said the hakim, hardly more than shaping the words with his
lips:<br>
 'How do you do, Mister O'Hara? I am jolly glad to see you
again.'</p>

<p>Kim's hand clenched about the pipe-stem. Anywhere on the open
road,<br>
 perhaps, he would not have been astonished; but here, in this
quiet<br>
 backwater of life, he was not prepared for Hurree Babu. It
annoyed<br>
 him, too, that he had been hoodwinked.</p>

<p>'Ah ha! I told you at Lucknow - resurgam - I shall rise again
and<br>
 you shall not know me. How much did you bet - eh?'</p>

<p>He chewed leisurely upon a few cardamom seeds, but he
breathed<br>
 uneasily.</p>

<p>'But why come here, Babuji?'</p>

<p>'Ah! Thatt is the question, as Shakespeare hath it. I come
to<br>
 congratulate you on your extraordinary effeecient performance
at<br>
 Delhi. Oah! I tell you we are all proud of you. It was
verree<br>
 neat and handy. Our mutual friend, he is old friend of mine. He
has<br>
 been in some dam'-tight places. Now he will be in some more.
He<br>
 told me; I tell Mr Lurgan; and he is pleased you graduate so
nicely.<br>
 All the Department is pleased.'</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, Kim thrilled to the clean
pride (it<br>
 can be a deadly pitfall, none the less) of Departmental praise
-<br>
 ensnaring praise from an equal of work appreciated by
fellow-<br>
 workers. Earth has nothing on the same plane to compare with
it.<br>
 But, cried the Oriental in him, Babus do not travel far to
retail<br>
 compliments.</p>

<p>'Tell thy tale, Babu,' he said authoritatively.</p>

<p>'Oah, it is nothing. Onlee I was at Simla when the wire came
in<br>
 about what our mutual friend said he had hidden, and old
Creighton -<br>
 ' He looked to see how Kim would take this piece of
audacity.</p>

<p>'The Colonel Sahib,' the boy from St Xavier's corrected.
'Of<br>
 course. He found me at a loose string, and I had to go down
to<br>
 Chitor to find that beastly letter. I do not like the South -
too<br>
 much railway travel; but I drew good travelling allowance. Ha!
Ha! I<br>
 meet our mutual at Delhi on the way back. He lies quiett just
now,<br>
 and says Saddhu-disguise suits him to the ground. Well, there
I<br>
 hear what you have done so well, so quickly, upon the
instantaneous<br>
 spur of the moment. I tell our mutual you take the bally bun,
by<br>
 Jove! It was splendid. I come to tell you so.'</p>

<p>'Umm!'</p>

<p>The frogs were busy in the ditches, and the moon slid to
her<br>
 setting. Some happy servant had gone out to commune with the
night<br>
 and to beat upon a drum. Kim's next sentence was in the
vernacular.</p>

<p>'How didst thou follow us?'</p>

<p>'Oah. Thatt was nothing. I know from our mutual friend you go
to<br>
 Saharunpore. So I come on. Red Lamas are not inconspicuous
persons.<br>
 I buy myself my drug-box, and I am very good doctor really. I go
to<br>
 Akrola of the Ford, and hear all about you, and I talk here and
talk<br>
 there. All the common people know what you do. I knew when
the<br>
 hospitable old lady sent the dooli. They have great
recollections of<br>
 the old lama's visits here. I know old ladies cannot keep
their<br>
 hands from medicines. So I am a doctor, and - you hear my talk?
I<br>
 think it is verree good. My word, Mister O'Hara, they know
about<br>
 you and the lama for fifty miles - the common people. So I come.
Do<br>
 you mind?'</p>

<p>'Babuji,' said Kim, looking up at the broad, grinning face, 'I
am a<br>
 Sahib.'</p>

<p>'My dear Mister O'Hara</p>

<p>'And I hope to play the Great Game.'</p>

<p>'You are subordinate to me departmentally at present.'</p>

<p>'Then why talk like an ape in a tree? Men do not come after
one from<br>
 Simla and change their dress, for the sake of a few sweet words.
I<br>
 am not a child. Talk Hindi and let us get to the yolk of the
egg.<br>
 Thou art here - speaking not one word of truth in ten. Why art
thou<br>
 here? Give a straight answer.'</p>

<p>'That is so verree disconcerting of the Europeans, Mister
O'Hara.<br>
 you should know a heap better at your time of life.'</p>

<p>'But I want to know,' said Kim, laughing. 'If it is the Game,
I may<br>
 help. How can I do anything if you bukh [babble] all round
the<br>
 shop?'</p>

<p>Hurree Babu reached for the pipe, and sucked it till it
guggled<br>
 again.</p>

<p>'Now I will speak vernacular. You sit tight, Mister O'Hara . .
. It<br>
 concerns the pedigree of a white stallion.'</p>

<p>'Still? That was finished long ago.'</p>

<p>'When everyone is dead the Great Game is finished. Not
before.<br>
 Listen to me till the end. There were Five Kings who prepared
a<br>
 sudden war three years ago, when thou wast given the
stallion's<br>
 pedigree by Mahbub Ali. Upon them, because of that news, and
ere<br>
 they were ready, fell our Army.'</p>

<p>'Ay - eight thousand men with guns. I remember that
night.'</p>

<p>'But the war was not pushed. That is the Government custom.
The<br>
 troops were recalled because the Government believed the Five
Kings<br>
 were cowed; and it is not cheap to feed men among the high
Passes.<br>
 HilaS and Bunar - Rajahs with guns - undertook for a price to
guard<br>
 the Passes against all coming from the North. They protested
both<br>
 fear and friendship.' He broke off with a giggle into English:
"Of<br>
 course, I tell you this unoffeecialiv to elucidate political<br>
 situation, Mister O'Hara. Offeecially, I am debarred from<br>
 criticizing any action of superiors. Now I go on. - This pleased
the<br>
 Government, anxious to avoid expense, and a bond was made for
so<br>
 many rupees a month that Hilas and Bunar should guard the Passes
as<br>
 soon as the State's troops were withdrawn. At that time - it
was<br>
 after we two met - I, who had been selling tea in Leh, became
a<br>
 clerk of accounts in the Army. When the troops were withdrawn,
I<br>
 was left behind to pay the coolies who made new roads in the
Hills.<br>
 This road-making was part of the bond between Bunar, Hilas, and
the<br>
 Government.'</p>

<p>'So? And then?'</p>

<p>'I tell you, it was jolly-beastly cold up there too, after
summer,'<br>
 said Hurree Babu confidentially. 'I was afraid these Bunar men
would<br>
 cut my throat every night for thee pay-chest. My native
sepoy-guard,<br>
 they laughed at me! By Jove! I was such a fearful man. Nevar
mind<br>
 thatt. I go on colloquially ... I send word many times that
these<br>
 two Kings were sold to the North; and Mahbub Ali, who was
yet<br>
 farther North, amply confirmed it. Nothing was done. Only my
feet<br>
 were frozen, and a toe dropped off. I sent word that the roads
for<br>
 which I was paying money to the diggers were being made for the
feet<br>
 of strangers and enemies.'</p>

<br>
'For?'

<p>'For the Russians. The thing was an open jest among the
coolies.<br>
 Then I was called down to tell what I knew by speech of
tongue.<br>
 Mahbub came South too. See the end! Over the Passes this year
after<br>
 snow-melting' - he shivered afresh - come two strangers under
cover<br>
 of shooting wild goats. They bear guns, but they bear also
chains<br>
 and levels and compasses.'</p>

<p>'Oho! The thing gets clearer.'</p>

<p>'They are well received by Hilas and Bunar. They make
great<br>
 promises; they speak as the mouthpiece of a Kaisar with gifts.
Up<br>
 the valleys, down the valleys go they, saying, "Here is a place
to<br>
 build a breastwork; here can ye pitch a fort. Here can ye hold
the<br>
 road against an army" - the very roads for which I paid out
the<br>
 rupees monthly. The Government knows', but does nothing. The
three<br>
 other Kings, who were not paid for guarding the Passes, tell
them by<br>
 runner of the bad faith of Bunar and Hilas. When all the evil
is<br>
 done, look you - when these two strangers with the levels and
the<br>
 compasses make the Five Kings to believe that a great army
will<br>
 sweep the Passes tomorrow or the next day - Hill-people are
all<br>
 fools - comes the order to me, Hurree Babu, "Go North and see
what<br>
 those strangers do." I say to Creighton Sahib, "This is not
a<br>
 lawsuit, that we go about to collect evidence."'Hurree returned
to<br>
 his English with a jerk: "'By Jove," I said, "why the dooce do
you<br>
 not issue demi-offeecial orders to some brave man to poison
them,<br>
 for an example? It is, if you permit the observation, most<br>
 reprehensible laxity on your part." And Colonel Creighton,
he<br>
 laughed at me! It is all your beastly English pride. You think
no<br>
 one dare conspire! That is all tommy-rott.'</p>

<p>Kim smoked slowly, revolving the business, so far as he
understood<br>
 it, in his quick mind.</p>

<p>'Then thou goest forth to follow the strangers?'</p>

<p>'No. To meet them. They are coming in to Simla to send down
their<br>
 horns and heads to be dressed at Calcutta. They are
exclusively<br>
 sporting gentlemen, and they are allowed special faceelities by
the<br>
 Government. Of course, we always do that. It is our British
pride.'</p>

<p>'Then what is to fear from them?'</p>

<p>'By Jove, they are not black people. I can do all sorts of
things<br>
 with black people, of course. They are Russians, and highly<br>
 unscrupulous people. I - I do not want to consort with them
without<br>
 a witness.'</p>

<p>'Will they kill thee?'</p>

<p>'Oah, thatt is nothing. I am good enough Herbert Spencerian,
I<br>
 trust, to meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate,
you<br>
 know. But - but they may beat me.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>Hurree Babu snapped his fingers with irritation. 'Of course I
shall<br>
 affeeliate myself to their camp in supernumerary capacity as
perhaps<br>
 interpreter, or person mentally impotent and hungree, or some
such<br>
 thing. And then I must pick up what I can, I suppose. That is
as<br>
 easy for me as playing Mister Doctor to the old lady. Onlee -
onlee<br>
 - you see, Mister O'Hara, I am unfortunately Asiatic, which
is<br>
 serious detriment in some respects. And all-so I am Bengali -
a<br>
 fearful man.'</p>

<p>'God made the Hare and the Bengali. What shame?' said Kim,
quoting<br>
 the proverb.</p>

<p>'It was process of Evolution, I think, from Primal Necessity,
but<br>
 the fact remains in all the cui bono. I am, oh, awfully fearful!
- I<br>
 remember once they wanted to cut off my head on the road to
Lhassa.<br>
 (No, I have never reached to Lhassa.) I sat down and cried,
Mister<br>
 O'Hara, anticipating Chinese tortures. I do not suppose these
two<br>
 gentlemen will torture me, but I like to provide for
possible<br>
 contingency with European assistance in emergency.' He coughed
and<br>
 spat out the cardamoms. 'It is purely unoffeecial indent, to
which<br>
 you can say "No, Babu". If you have no pressing engagement with
your<br>
 old man - perhaps you might divert him; perhaps I can seduce
his<br>
 fancies - I should like you to keep in Departmental touch with
me<br>
 till I find those sporting coves. I have great opeenion of
you<br>
 since I met my friend at Delhi. And also I will embody your name
in<br>
 my offeecial report when matter is finally adjudicated. It will
be<br>
 a great feather in your cap. That is why I come really.</p>

<p>'Humph! The end of the tale, I think, is true; but what of
the<br>
 fore-part?'</p>

<p>'About the Five Kings? Oah! there is ever so much truth in it.
A<br>
 lots more than you would suppose,' said Hurree earnestly. 'You
come<br>
 - eh? I go from here straight into the Doon. It is verree
verdant<br>
 and painted meads. I shall go to Mussoorie to good old
Munsoorie<br>
 Pahar, as the gentlemen and ladies say. Then by Rampur into
Chini.<br>
 That is the only way they can come. I do not like waiting in
the<br>
 cold, but we must wait for them. I want to walk with them to
Simla.<br>
 You see, one Russian is a Frenchman, and I know my French
pretty<br>
 well. I have friends in Chandernagore.'</p>

<p>'He would certainly rejoice to see the Hills again,' said
Kim<br>
 meditatively. 'All his speech these ten days past has been of
little<br>
 else. If we go together -'</p>

<p>'Oah! We can be quite strangers on the road, if your lama
prefers. I<br>
 shall just be four or five miles ahead. There is no hurry for
Hurree<br>
 - that is an Europe pun, ha! ha! - and you come after. There
is<br>
 plenty of time; they will plot and survey and map, of course.
I<br>
 shall go tomorrow, and you the next day, if you choose. Eh? You
go<br>
 think on it till morning. By Jove, it is near morning now.'
He<br>
 yawned ponderously, and with never a civil word lumbered off to
his<br>
 sleeping-place. But Kim slept little, and his thoughts ran
in<br>
 Hindustani:</p>

<p>'Well is the Game called great! I was four days a scullion
at<br>
 Quetta, waiting on the wife of the man whose book I stole. And
that<br>
 was part of the Great Game! From the South - God knows how far
-<br>
 came up the Mahratta, playing the Great Game in fear of his
life.<br>
 Now I shall go far and far into the North playing the Great
Game.<br>
 Truly, it runs like a shuttle throughout all Hind. And my share
and<br>
 my joy' - he smiled to the darkness-'I owe to the lama here.
Also to<br>
 Mahbub Ali - also to Creighton Sahib, but chiefly to the Holy
One.<br>
 He is right - a great and a wonderful world - and I am Kim - Kim
-<br>
 Kim - alone - one person - in the middle of it all. But I will
see<br>
 these strangers with their levels and chains . . .'</p>

<p>'What was the upshot of last night's babble?' said the lama,
after<br>
 his orisons</p>

<p>'There came a strolling seller of drugs - a hanger-on of
the<br>
 Sahiba's. Him I abolished by arguments and prayers, proving
that<br>
 our charms are worthier than his coloured waters.'</p>

<p>'Alas, my charms! Is the virtuous woman still bent upon a new
one?'</p>

<p>'Very strictly.'</p>

<p>'Then it must be written, or she will deafen me with her
clamour.'<br>
 He fumbled at his pencase.</p>

<p>'In the Plains,' said Kim, 'are always too many people. In
the<br>
 Hills, as I understand, there are fewer.'</p>

<p>'Oh! the Hills, and the snows upon the Hills.' The lami tore
off a<br>
 tiny square of paper fit to go in an amulet. 'But what dost
thou<br>
 know of the Hills?'</p>

<p>'They are very close.' Kim thrust open the door and looked at
the<br>
 long, peaceful line of the Himalayas flushed in morning-
gold.<br>
 'Except in the dress of a Sahib, I have never set foot among
them.'</p>

<p>The lama snuffed the wind wistfully.</p>

<p>'If we go North,' - Kim put the question to the waking sunrise
-<br>
 'would not much mid-day heat be avoided by walking among the
lower<br>
 hills at least? ... Is the charm made, Holy One?'</p>

<p>'I have written the names of seven silly devils - not one of
whom is<br>
 worth a grain of dust in the eye. Thus do foolish women drag
us<br>
 from the Way!'</p>

<p>Hurree Babu came out from behind the dovecote washing his
teeth with<br>
 ostentatious ritual. Full-fleshed, heavy-haunched, bull-necked,
and<br>
 deep-voiced, he did not look like 'a fearful man'. Kim
signed<br>
 almost imperceptibly that matters were in good train, and when
the<br>
 morning toilet was over, Hurree Babu, in flowery speech, came to
do<br>
 honour to the lama. They ate, of course, apart, and afterwards
the<br>
 old lady, more or less veiled behind a window, returned to the
vital<br>
 business of green-mango colics in the young. The lama's
knowledge of<br>
 medicine "was, of course, sympathetic only. He believed that
the<br>
 dung of a black horse, mixed with sulphur, and carried in a
snake-<br>
 skin, was a sound remedy for cholera; but the symbolism
interested<br>
 him far more than the science. Hurree Babu deferred to these
views<br>
 with enchanting politeness, so that the lama called him a
courteous<br>
 physician. Hurree Babu replied that he was no more than an
inexpert<br>
 dabbler in the mysteries; but at least - he thanked the Gods<br>
 therefore - he knew when he sat in the presence of a master.
He<br>
 himself had been taught by the Sahibs, who do not consider
expense,<br>
 in the lordly halls of Calcutta; but, as he was ever first
to<br>
 acknowledge, there lay a wisdom behind earthly wisdom - the high
and<br>
 lonely lore of meditation. Kim looked on with envy. The Hurree
Babu<br>
 of his knowledge - oily, effusive, and nervous - was gone;
gone,<br>
 too, was the brazen drug-vendor of overnight. There remained
-<br>
 polished, polite, attentive - a sober, learned son of experience
and<br>
 adversity, gathering wisdom from the lama's lips. The old
lady<br>
 confided to Kim that these rare levels were beyond her. She
liked<br>
 charms with plenty of ink that one could wash off in water,
swallow,<br>
 and be done with. Else what was the use of the Gods? She liked
men<br>
 and women, and she spoke of them - of kinglets she had known in
the<br>
 past; of her own youth and beauty; of the depredations of
leopards<br>
 and the eccentricities of love Asiatic; of the incidence of<br>
 taxation, rack-renting, funeral ceremonies, her son-in-law (this
by<br>
 allusion, easy to be followed), the care of the young, and the
age's<br>
 lack of decency. And Kim, as interested in the life of this
world as<br>
 she soon to leave it, squatted with his feet under the hem of
his<br>
 robe, drinking all in, while the lama demolished one after
another<br>
 every theory of body-curing put forward by Hurree Babu.</p>

<p>At noon the Babu strapped up his brass-bound drug-box, took
his<br>
 patent-leather shoes of ceremony in one hand, a gay
blue-and-white<br>
 umbrella in the other, and set off northwards to the Doon,
where, he<br>
 said, he was in demand among the lesser kings of those
parts.</p>

<p>'We will go in the cool of the evening, chela,' said the lama.
'That<br>
 doctor, learned in physic and courtesy, affirms that the
people<br>
 among these lower hills are devout, generous, and much in need
of a<br>
 teacher. In a very short time - so says the hakim - we come to
cool<br>
 air and the smell of pines.'</p>

<p>'Ye go to the Hills? And by Kulu road? Oh, thrice happy!'
shrilled<br>
 the old lady. 'But that I am a little pressed with the care of
the<br>
 homestead I would take palanquin ... but that would be
shameless,<br>
 and my reputation would be cracked. Ho! Ho! I know the road -
every<br>
 march of the road I know. Ye will find charity throughout - it
is<br>
 not denied to the well-looking. I will give orders for
provision. A<br>
 servant to set you forth upon your journey? No ... Then I will
at<br>
 least cook ye good food.'</p>

<p>'What a woman is the Sahiba!' said the white-bearded Oorya,
when a<br>
 tumult rose by the kitchen quarters. 'She has never forgotten
a<br>
 friend: she has never forgotten an enemy in all her years. And
her<br>
 cookery - wah!' He rubbed his slim stomach.</p>

<p>There were cakes, there were sweetmeats, there was cold fowl
stewed<br>
 to rags with rice and prunes - enough to burden Kim like a
mule.</p>

<p>'I am old and useless,' she said. 'None now love me - and
none<br>
 respect - but there are few to compare with me when I call on
the<br>
 Gods and squat to my cooking-pots. Come again, O people of
good<br>
 will. Holy One and disciple, come again. The room is always<br>
 prepared; the welcome is always ready ... See the women do
not<br>
 follow thy chela too openly. I know the women of Kulu. Take
heed,<br>
 chela, lest he run away when he smells his Hills again ... Hai!
Do<br>
 not tilt the rice-bag upside down ... Bless the household, Holy
One,<br>
 and forgive thy servant her stupidities.'</p>

<p>She wiped her red old eyes on a corner of her veil, and
clucked<br>
 throatily.</p>

<p>'Women talk,' said the lama at last, 'but that is a
woman's<br>
 infirmity. I gave her a charm. She is upon the Wheel and
wholly<br>
 given over to the shows of this life, but none the less, chela,
she<br>
 is virtuous, kindly, hospitable - of a whole and zealous heart.
Who<br>
 shall say she does not acquire merit?'</p>

<p>'Not I, Holy One,' said Kim, reslinging the bountiful
provision on<br>
 his shoulders. 'In my mind - behind my eyes - I have tried
to<br>
 picture such an one altogether freed from the Wheel -
desiring<br>
 nothing, causing nothing - a nun, as it were'</p>

<p>'And, O imp?' The lama almost laughed aloud.</p>

<p>'I cannot make the picture.'</p>

<p>'Nor I. But there are many, many millions of lives before her.
She<br>
 will get wisdom a little, it may be, in each one.'</p>

<p>'And will she forget how to make stews with saffron upon that
road?'</p>

<p>'Thy mind is set on things unworthy. But she has skill. I
am<br>
 refreshed all over. When we reach the lower hills I shall be
yet<br>
 stronger. The hakim spoke truly to me this morn when he said
a<br>
 breath from the snows blows away twenty years from the life of
a<br>
 man. We will go up into the Hills - the high hills - up to
the<br>
 sound of snow-waters and the sound of the trees - for a
little<br>
 while. The hakim said that at any time we may return to the
Plains,<br>
 for we do no more than skirt the pleasant places. The hakim is
full<br>
 of learning; but he is in no way proud. I spoke to him - when
thou<br>
 wast talking to the Sahiba - of a certain dizziness that lays
hold<br>
 upon the back of my neck in the night, and he said it rose
from<br>
 excessive heat - to be cured by cool air. Upon consideration,
I<br>
 marvelled that I had not thought of such a simple remedy.'</p>

<p>'Didst thou tell him of thy Search?' said Kim, a little
jealously.<br>
 He preferred to sway the lama by his own speech - not through
the<br>
 wiles of Hurree Babu.</p>

<p>'Assuredly. I told him of my dream, and of the manner by which
I had<br>
 acquired merit by causing thee to be taught wisdom.'</p>

<p>'Thou didst not say I was a Sahib?'</p>

<p>'What need? I have told thee many times we be but two souls
seeking<br>
 escape. He said - and he is just herein - that the River of
Healing<br>
 will break forth even as I dreamed - at my feet, if need be.
Having<br>
 found the Way, seest thou, that shall free me from the Wheel,
need I<br>
 trouble to find a way about the mere fields of earth - which
are<br>
 illusion? That were senseless. I have my dreams, night upon
night<br>
 repeated; I have Fataka; and I have thee, Friend of all the
World.<br>
 It was written in thy horoscope that a Red Bull on a green field
- I<br>
 have not forgotten - should bring thee to honour. Who but I saw
that<br>
 prophecy accomplished? Indeed, I was the instrument. Thou shalt
find<br>
 me my River, being in return the instrument. The Search is
sure!'</p>

<p>He set his ivory-yellow face, serene and untroubled, towards
the<br>
 beckoning Hills; his shadow shouldering far before him in the
dust.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><br>
 Who hath desired the Sea - the immense and contemptuous
surges?<br>
 The shudder, the stumble, the swerve ere the star-stabbing
bowsprit<br>
 merges -<br>
 The orderly clouds of the Trades and the ridged roaring<br>
 sapphire thereunder -<br>
 Unheralded cliff-lurking flaws and the head-sails'
low-volleying<br>
 thunder?<br>
 His Sea in no wonder the same - his Sea and the same in each
wonder<br>
 -<br>
 His Sea that his being fulfils?<br>
 So and no otherwise - so and no otherwise hill-men desire
their<br>
 hills!</p>

<p>The Sea and the Hills.</p>

<p>'Who goes to the hills goes to his mother.'</p>

<p>They had crossed the Siwaliks and the half-tropical Doon,
left<br>
 Mussoorie behind them, and headed north along the narrow
hill-roads.<br>
 Day after day they struck deeper into the huddled mountains, and
day<br>
 after day Kim watched the lama return to a man's strength. Among
the<br>
 terraces of the Doon he had leaned on the boy's shoulder, ready
to<br>
 profit by wayside halts. Under the great ramp to Mussoorie he
drew<br>
 himself together as an old hunter faces a well-remembered bank,
and<br>
 where he should have sunk exhausted swung his long draperies
about<br>
 him, drew a deep double-lungful of the diamond air, and walked
as<br>
 only a hillman can. Kim, plains-bred and plains-fed, sweated
and<br>
 panted astonished. 'This is my country,' said the lama.
'Beside<br>
 Such-zen, this is flatter than a rice-field'; and with
steady,<br>
 driving strokes from the loins he strode upwards. But it was on
the<br>
 steep downhill marches, three thousand feet in three hours, that
he<br>
 went utterly away from Kim, whose back ached with holding back,
and<br>
 whose big toe was nigh cut off by his grass sandal-string.
Through<br>
 the speckled shadow of the great deodar-forests; through oak<br>
 feathered and plumed with ferns; birch, ilex, rhododendron,
and<br>
 pine, out on to the bare hillsides' slippery sunburnt grass,
and<br>
 back into the woodlands' coolth again, till oak gave way to
bamboo<br>
 and palm of the valley, the lama swung untiring.</p>

<p><br>
 Glancing back in the twilight at the huge ridges behind him and
the<br>
 faint, thin line of the road whereby they had come, he would
lay<br>
 out, with a hillman's generous breadth of vision, fresh marches
for<br>
 the morrow; or, halting in the neck of some uplifted pass that
gave<br>
 on Spiti and Kulu, would stretch out his hands yearningly
towards<br>
 the high snows of the horizon. In the dawns they flared
windy-red<br>
 above stark blue, as Kedar- nath and Badrinath - kings of
that<br>
 wilderness - took the first sunlight. All day long they lay
like<br>
 molten silver under the sun, and at evening put on their
jewels<br>
 again. At first they breathed temperately upon the travellers,
winds<br>
 good to meet when one crawled over some gigantic hog's-back; but
in<br>
 a few days, at a height of nine or ten thousand feet, those
breezes<br>
 bit; and Kim kindly allowed a village of hillmen to acquire
merit by<br>
 giving him a rough blanket-coat. The lama was mildly surprised
that<br>
 anyone should object to the knife-edged breezes which had cut
the<br>
 years off his shoulders.</p>

<p>'These are but the lower hills, chela. There is no cold till
we come<br>
 to the true Hills.'</p>

<p>'Air and water are good, and the people are devout enough, but
the<br>
 food is very bad,' Kim growled; 'and we walk as though we were
mad -<br>
 or English. It freezes at night, too.'</p>

<p>'A little, maybe; but only enough to make old bones rejoice in
the<br>
 sun. We must not always delight in soft beds and rich food.'</p>

<p>'We might at least keep to the road.'</p>

<p>Kim had all a plainsman's affection for the well-trodden
track, not<br>
 six feet wide, that snaked among the mountains; but the lama,
being<br>
 Tibetan, could not refrain from short cuts over spurs and the
rims<br>
 of gravel-strewn slopes. As he explained to his limping
disciple, a<br>
 man bred among mountains can prophesy the course of a
mountain-road,<br>
 and though low-lying clouds might be a hindrance to a
short-cutting<br>
 stranger, they made no earthly difference to a thoughtful man.
Thus,<br>
 after long hours of what would be reckoned very fair
mountaineering<br>
 in civilized countries, they would pant over a saddle-back,
sidle<br>
 past a few landslips, and drop through forest at an angle of
forty-<br>
 five onto the road again. Along their track lay the villages of
the<br>
 hillfolk - mud and earth huts, timbers now and then rudely
carved<br>
 with an axe - clinging like swallows' nests against the
steeps,<br>
 huddled on tiny flats half-way down a three-thousand-foot
glissade;<br>
 jammed into a corner between cliffs that funnelled and focused
every<br>
 wandering blast; or, for the sake of summer pasture, cowering
down<br>
 on a neck that in winter would be ten feet deep in snow. And
the<br>
 people - the sallow, greasy, duffle- clad people, with short
bare<br>
 legs and faces almost Esquimaux - would flock out and adore.
The<br>
 Plains - kindly and gentle - had treated the lama as a holy
man<br>
 among holy men. But the Hills worshipped him as one in the<br>
 confidence of all their devils. Theirs was an almost
obliterated<br>
 Buddhism, overlaid with a nature-worship fantastic as their
own<br>
 landscapes, elaborate as the terracing of their tiny fields;
but<br>
 they recognized the big hat, the clicking rosary, and the
rare<br>
 Chinese texts for great authority; and they respected the
man<br>
 beneath the hat.</p>

<p>'We saw thee come down over the black Breasts of Eua,' said a
Betah<br>
 who gave them cheese, sour milk, and stone-hard bread one
evening.<br>
 'We do not use that often - except when calving cows stray
in<br>
 summer. There is a sudden wind among those stones that casts
men<br>
 down on the stillest day. But what should such folk care for
the<br>
 Devil of Eua!'</p>

<p>Then did Kim, aching in every fibre, dizzy with looking
down,<br>
 footsore with cramping desperate toes into inadequate crannies,
take<br>
 joy in the day's march - such joy as a boy of St Xavier's who
had<br>
 won the quarter-mile on the flat might take in the praises of
his<br>
 friends. The hills sweated the ghi and sugar suet off his
bones;<br>
 the dry air, taken sobbingly at the head of cruel passes, firmed
and<br>
 built out his upper ribs; and the tilted levels put new hard
muscles<br>
 into calf and thigh.</p>

<p>They meditated often on the Wheel of Life - the more so since,
as<br>
 the lama said, they were freed from its visible temptations.
Except<br>
 the grey eagle and an occasional far-seen bear grubbing and
rooting<br>
 on the hillside; a vision of a furious painted leopard met at
dawn<br>
 in a still valley devouring a goat; and now and again a
bright-<br>
 coloured bird, they were alone with the winds and the grass
singing<br>
 under the wind. The women of the smoky huts over whose roofs
the<br>
 two walked as they descended the mountains, were unlovely
and<br>
 unclean, wives of many husbands, and afflicted with goitre. The
men<br>
 were woodcutters when they were not farmers - meek, and of
an<br>
 incredible simplicity. But that suitable discourse might not
fail,<br>
 Fate sent them, overtaking and overtaken upon the road, the<br>
 courteous Dacca physician, who paid for his food in ointments
good<br>
 for goitre and counsels that restore peace between men and
women. He<br>
 seemed to know these hills as well as he knew the hill dialects,
and<br>
 gave the lama the lie of the land towards Ladakh and Tibet. He
said<br>
 they could return to the Plains at any moment. Meantime, for
such as<br>
 loved mountains, yonder road might amuse. This was not all
revealed<br>
 in a breath, but at evening encounters on the stone
threshing-<br>
 floors, when, patients disposed of, the doctor would smoke and
the<br>
 lama snuff, while Kim watched the wee cows grazing on the
housetops,<br>
 or threw his soul after his eyes across the deep blue gulfs
between<br>
 range and range. And there were talks apart in the dark woods,
when<br>
 the doctor would seek herbs, and Kim, as budding physician,
must<br>
 accompany him.</p>

<p>'You see, Mister O'Hara, I do not know what the deuce-an'- all
I<br>
 shall do when I find our sporting friends; but if you will
kindly<br>
 keep within sight of my umbrella, which is fine fixed point
for<br>
 cadastral survey, I shall feel much better.'</p>

<p>Kim looked out across the jungle of peaks. 'This is not my
country,<br>
 hakim. Easier, I think, to find one louse in a bear-skin.'</p>

<p>'Oah, thatt is my strong points. There is no hurry for Hurree.
They<br>
 were at Leh not so long ago. They said they had come down from
the<br>
 Karakorum with their heads and horns and all. I am onlee afraid
they<br>
 will have sent back all their letters and compromising things
from<br>
 Leh into Russian territoree. Of course they will walk away as
far to<br>
 the East as possible - just to show that they were never among
the<br>
 Western States. You do not know the Hills?' He scratched with a
twig<br>
 on the earth. 'Look! They should have come in by Srinagar or<br>
 Abbottabad. Thatt is their short road - down the river by Bunji
and<br>
 Astor. But they have made mischief in the West. So' - he drew
a<br>
 furrow from left to right - 'they march and they march away East
to<br>
 Leh (ah! it is cold there), and down the Indus to Hanle (I know
that<br>
 road), and then down, you see, to Bushahr and Chini valley. That
is<br>
 ascertained by process of elimination, and also by asking
questions<br>
 from people that I cure so well. Our friends have been a long
time<br>
 playing about and producing impressions. So they are well known
from<br>
 far off. You will see me catch them somewhere in Chini
valley.<br>
 Please keep your eye on the umbrella.'</p>

<p>It nodded like a wind-blown harebell down the valleys and
round the<br>
 mountain sides, and in due time the lama and Kim, who steered
by<br>
 compass, would overhaul it, vending ointments and powders at<br>
 eventide. 'We came by such and such a way!' The lama would throw
a<br>
 careless finger backward at the ridges, and the umbrella
would<br>
 expend itself in compliments.</p>

<p>They crossed a snowy pass in cold moonlight, when the lama,
mildly<br>
 chaffing Kim, went through up to his knees, like a Bactrian
camel -<br>
 the snow-bred, shag-haired sort that came into the Kashmir
Serai.<br>
 They dipped across beds of light snow and snow-powdered shale,
where<br>
 they took refuge from a gale in a camp of Tibetans hurrying
down<br>
 tiny sheep, each laden with a bag of borax. They came out
upon<br>
 grassy shoulders still snow-speckled, and through forest, to
grass<br>
 anew. For all their marchings, Kedarnath and Badrinath were
not<br>
 impressed; and it was only after days of travel that Kim,
uplifted<br>
 upon some insignificant ten-thousand-foot hummock, could see
that a<br>
 shoulder-knot or horn of the two great lords had - ever so
slightly<br>
 - changed outline.</p>

<p>At last they entered a world within a world - a valley of
leagues<br>
 where the high hills were fashioned of a mere rubble and refuse
from<br>
 off the knees of the mountains. Here one day's march carried
them no<br>
 farther, it seemed, than a dreamer's clogged pace bears him in
a<br>
 nightmare. They skirted a shoulder painfully for hours, and,<br>
 behold, it was but an outlying boss in an outlying buttress of
the<br>
 main pile! A rounded meadow revealed itself, when they had
reached<br>
 it, for a vast tableland running far into the valley. Three
days<br>
 later, it was a dim fold in the earth to southward.</p>

<p>'Surely the Gods live here!' said Kim, beaten down by the
silence<br>
 and the appalling sweep and dispersal of the cloud-shadows
after<br>
 rain. 'This is no place for men!'</p>

<p>'Long and long ago,' said the lama, as to himself, 'it was
asked of<br>
 the Lord whether the world were everlasting. o this the
Excellent<br>
 One returned no answer ... When I was in Ceylon, a wise
Seeker<br>
 confirmed that from the gospel which is written in Pali.
Certainly,<br>
 since we know the way to Freedom, the question were
unprofitable,<br>
 but - look, and know illusion, chela! These- are the true
Hills!<br>
 They are like my hills by Suchzen. Never were such hills!'</p>

<p>Above them, still enormously above them, earth towered away
towards<br>
 the snow-line, where from east to west across hundreds of
miles,<br>
 ruled as with a ruler, the last of the bold birches stopped.
Above<br>
 that, in scarps and blocks upheaved, the rocks strove to fight
their<br>
 heads above the white smother. Above these again, changeless
since<br>
 the world's beginning, but changing to every mood of sun and
cloud,<br>
 lay out the eternal snow. They could see blots and blurs on its
face<br>
 where storm and wandering wullie-wa got up to dance. Below them,
as<br>
 they stood, the forest slid away in a sheet of blue-green for
mile<br>
 upon mile; below the forest was a village in its sprinkle of<br>
 terraced fields and steep grazing-grounds. Below the village
they<br>
 knew, though a thunderstorm worried and growled there for
the<br>
 moment, a pitch of twelve or fifteen hundred feet gave to the
moist<br>
 valley where the streams gather that are the mothers of
young<br>
 Sutluj.</p>

<p>As usual, the lama had led Kim by cow-track and by-road, far
from<br>
 the main route along which Hurree Babu, that 'fearful man',
had<br>
 bucketed three days before through a storm to which nine
Englishmen<br>
 out of ten would have given full right of way. Hurree was no
game-<br>
 shot - the snick of a trigger made him change colour - but, as
he<br>
 himself would have said, he was 'fairly effeecient stalker', and
he<br>
 had raked the huge valley with a pair of cheap binoculars to
some<br>
 purpose. Moreover, the white of worn canvas tents against
green<br>
 carries far. Hurree Babu had seen all he wanted to see when he
sat<br>
 on the threshing-floor of Ziglaur, twenty miles away as the
eagle<br>
 flies, and forty by road - that is to say, two small dots which
one<br>
 day were just below the snow-line, and the next had moved
downward<br>
 perhaps six inches on the hillside. Once cleaned out and set to
the<br>
 work, his fat bare legs could cover a surprising amount of
ground,<br>
 and this was the reason why, while Kim and the lama lay in a
leaky<br>
 hut at Ziglaur till the storm should be over-past, an oily, wet,
but<br>
 always smiling Bengali, talking the best of English with the
vilest<br>
 of phrases, was ingratiating himself with two sodden and
rather<br>
 rheumatic foreigners. He had arrived, revolving many wild
schemes,<br>
 on the heels of a thunderstorm which had split a pine over
against<br>
 their camp, and so convinced a dozen or two forcibly
impressed<br>
 baggage-coolies the day was inauspicious for farther travel
that<br>
 with one accord they had thrown down their loads and jibbed.
They<br>
 were subjects of a Hill Rajah who farmed out their services, as
is<br>
 the custom, for his private gain; and, to add to their
personal<br>
 distresses, the strange Sahibs had already threatened them
with<br>
 rifles. The most of them knew rifles and Sahibs of old: they
were<br>
 trackers and shikarris of the Northern valleys, keen after bear
and<br>
 wild goat; but they had never been thus treated in their lives.
So<br>
 the forest took them to her bosom, and, for all oaths and
clamour,<br>
 refused to restore. There was no need to feign madness or - the
Babu<br>
 had thought of another means of securing a welcome. He wrung out
his<br>
 wet clothes, slipped on his patent-leather shoes, opened the
blue-<br>
 and-white umbrella, and with mincing gait and a heart
beating<br>
 against his tonsils appeared as 'agent for His Royal Highness,
the<br>
 Rajah of Rampur, gentlemen. What can I do for you, please?'</p>

<p>The gentlemen were delighted. One was visibly French, the
other<br>
 Russian, but they spoke English not much inferior to the
Babu's.<br>
 They begged his kind offices. Their native servants had gone
sick at<br>
 Leh. They had hurried on because they were anxious to bring
the<br>
 spoils of the chase to Simla ere the skins grew moth-eaten.
They<br>
 bore a general letter of introduction (the Babu salaamed to
it<br>
 orientally) to all Government officials. No, they had not met
any<br>
 other shooting-parties en route. They did for themselves. They
had<br>
 plenty of supplies. They only wished to push on as soon as might
be.<br>
 At this he waylaid a cowering hillman among the trees, and
after<br>
 three minutes' talk and a little silver (one cannot be
economical<br>
 upon State service, though Hurree's heart bled at the waste)
the<br>
 eleven coolies and the three hangers-on reappeared. At least
the<br>
 Babu would be a witness to their oppression.</p>

<p>'My royal master, he will be much annoyed, but these people
are<br>
 onlee common people and grossly ignorant. If your honours
will<br>
 kindly overlook unfortunate affair, I shall be much pleased. In
a<br>
 little while rain will stop and we can then proceed. You have
been<br>
 shooting, eh? That is fine performance!'</p>

<p>He skipped nimbly from one kilta to the next, making pretence
to<br>
 adjust each conical basket. The Englishman is not, as a
rule,<br>
 familiar with the Asiatic, but he would not strike across the
wrist<br>
 a kindly Babu who had accidentally upset a kilta with a red
oilskin<br>
 top. On the other hand, he would not press drink upon a Babu
were<br>
 he never so friendly, nor would he invite him to meat. The<br>
 strangers did all these things, and asked many questions -
about<br>
 women mostly - to which Hurree returned gay and unstudied
answers.<br>
 They gave him a glass of whitish fluid like to gin, and then
more;<br>
 and in a little time his gravity departed from him. He
became<br>
 thickly treasonous, and spoke in terms of sweeping indecency of
a<br>
 Government which had forced upon him a white man's education
and<br>
 neglected to supply him with a white man's salary. He babbled
tales<br>
 of oppression and wrong till the tears ran down his cheeks for
the<br>
 miseries of his land. Then he staggered off, singing love-songs
of<br>
 Lower Bengal, and collapsed upon a wet tree-trunk. Never was
so<br>
 unfortunate a product of English rule in India more unhappily
thrust<br>
 upon aliens.</p>

<br>
'They are all just of that pattern,' said one sportsman to the
other <br>
in French. 'When we get into India proper thou wilt see. I should
<br>
like to visit his Rajah. One might speak the good word there. It
is <br>
possible that he has heard of us and wishes to signify his
good-<br>
will.'

<p>'We have not time. We must get into Simla as soon as may be,'
his<br>
 companion replied. 'For my own part, I wish our reports had
been<br>
 sent back from Hilas, or even Leh.'</p>

<p>'The English post is better and safer. Remember we are given
all<br>
 facilities - and Name of God! - they give them to us too! Is
it<br>
 unbelievable stupidity?'</p>

<p>'It is pride - pride that deserves and will receive
punishment.'</p>

<p>'Yes! To fight a fellow-Continental in our game is something.
There<br>
 is a risk attached, but these people - bah! It is too easy.'</p>

<p>'Pride - all pride, my friend.'</p>

<p>'Now what the deuce is good of Chandernagore being so close
to<br>
 Calcutta and all,' said Hurree, snoring open-mouthed on the
sodden<br>
 moss, 'if I cannot understand their French? They talk so<br>
 particularly fast! It would have been much better to cut
their<br>
 beastly throats.'</p>

<p>When he presented himself again he was racked with a headache
-<br>
 penitent, and volubly afraid that in his drunkenness he might
have<br>
 been indiscreet. He loved the British Government - it was the
source<br>
 of all prosperity and honour, and his master at Rampur held the
very<br>
 same opinion. Upon this the men began to deride him and to
quote<br>
 past words, till step by step, with deprecating smirks, oily
grins,<br>
 and leers of infinite cunning, the poor Babu was beaten out of
his<br>
 defences and forced to speak - truth. When Lurgan was told the
tale<br>
 later, he mourned aloud that he could not have been in the place
of<br>
 the stubborn, inattentive coolies, who with grass mats over
their<br>
 heads and the raindrops puddling in their footprints, waited on
the<br>
 wea- ther. All the Sahibs of their acquaintance - rough-clad
men<br>
 joyously returning year after year to their chosen gullies -
had<br>
 servants and cooks and orderlies, very often hillmen. These
Sahibs<br>
 travelled without any retinue. Therefore they were poor Sahibs,
and<br>
 ignorant; for no Sahib in his senses would follow a
Bengali's<br>
 advice. But the Bengali, appearing from somewhere, had given
them<br>
 money, and could make shift with their dialect. Used to<br>
 comprehensive ill-treatment from their own colour, they
suspected a<br>
 trap somewhere, and stood by to run if occasion offered.</p>

<p>Then through the new-washed air, steaming with delicious
earth-<br>
 smells, the Babu led the way down the slopes - walking ahead of
the<br>
 coolies in pride; walking behind the foreigners in humility.
His<br>
 thoughts were many and various. The least of them would have<br>
 interested his companions beyond words. But he was an
agreeable<br>
 guide, ever keen to point out the beauties of his royal
master's<br>
 domain. He peopled the hills with anything thev had a mind to
slay -<br>
 thar, ibex, or markhor, and bear by Elisha's allowance. He<br>
 discoursed of botany and ethnology with unimpeachable
inaccuracy,<br>
 and his store of local legends - he had been a trusted agent of
the<br>
 State for fifteen years, remember - was inexhaustible.</p>

<p>'Decidedly this fellow is an original,' said the taller of the
two<br>
 foreigners. 'He is like the nightmare of a Viennese
courier.'</p>

<p>'He represents in little India in transition - the
monstrous<br>
 hybridism of East and West,' the Russian replied. 'It is we who
can<br>
 deal with Orientals.'</p>

<p>'He has lost his own country and has not acquired any other.
But he<br>
 has a most complete hatred of his conquerors. Listen. He
confided to<br>
 me last night,' said the other.</p>

<p>Under the striped umbrella Hurree Babu was straining ear and
brain<br>
 to follow the quick-poured French, and keeping both eyes on a
kilta<br>
 full of maps and documents - an extra-large one with a double
red<br>
 oil-skin cover. He did not wish to steal anything. He only
desired<br>
 to know what to steal, and, incidentally, how to get away when
he<br>
 had stolen it. He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and
Herbert<br>
 Spencer, that there remained some valuables to steal.</p>

<p>On the second dav the road rose steeply to a grass spur above
the<br>
 forest; and it was here, about sunset, that they came across an
aged<br>
 lama - but they called him a bonze - sitting cross-legged above
a<br>
 mysterious chart held down by stones, which he was explaining to
a<br>
 young man, evidently a neophyte, of singular, though
unwashen,<br>
 beauty. The striped umbrella had been sighted half a march away,
and<br>
 Kim had suggested a halt till it came up to them.</p>

<p>'Ha!' said Hurree Babu, resourceful as Puss-in-Boots. 'That
is<br>
 eminent local holy man. Probably subject of my royal
master.'</p>

<p>'What is he doing? It is very curious.'</p>

<p>'He is expounding holy picture - all hand-worked.'</p>

<p>The two men stood bareheaded in the wash of the afternoon
sunlight<br>
 low across the gold-coloured grass. The sullen coolies, glad of
the<br>
 check, halted and slid down their loads.</p>

<p>'Look!' said the Frenchman. 'It is like a picture for the
birth of a<br>
 religion - the first teacher and the first disciple. Is he a<br>
 Buddhist?'</p>

<p>'Of some debased kind,' the other answered. 'There are no
true<br>
 Buddhists among the Hills. But look at the folds of the
drapery.<br>
 Look at his eyes - how insolent! Why does this make one feel
that we<br>
 are so young a people?' The speaker struck passionately at a
tall<br>
 weed. 'We have nowhere left our mark yet. Nowhere! That, do
you<br>
 understand, is what disquiets me.' He scowled at the placid
face,<br>
 and the monumental calm of the pose.</p>

<p>'Have patience. We shall make your mark together - we and you
young<br>
 people. Meantime, draw his picture.'</p>

<p>The Babu advanced loftily; his back out of all keeping with
his<br>
 deferential speech, or his wink towards Kim.</p>

<p>'Holy One, these be Sahibs. My medicines cured one of a flux,
and I<br>
 go into Simla to oversee his recovery. They wish to see thy
picture<br>
 -'</p>

<p>'To heal the sick is always good. This is the Wheel of Life,'
said<br>
 the lama, 'the same I showed thee in the hut at Ziglaur when
the<br>
 rain fell.'</p>

<p>'And to hear thee expound it.'</p>

<p>The lama's eyes lighted at the prospect of new listeners.
'To<br>
 expound the Most Excellent Way is good. Have they any knowledge
of<br>
 Hindi, such as had the Keeper of Images?'</p>

<p>'A little, maybe.'</p>

<p>Hereat, simply as a child engrossed with a new game, the lama
threw<br>
 back his head and began the full-throated invocation of the
Doctor<br>
 of Divinity ere he opens the full doctrine. The strangers leaned
on<br>
 their alpenstocks and listened. Kim, squatting humbly, watched
the<br>
 red sunlight on their faces, and the blend and parting of their
long<br>
 shadows. They wore un-English leggings and curious girt-in
belts<br>
 that reminded him hazily of the pictures in a book in St
Xavier's<br>
 library "The Adventures of a Young Naturalist in Mexico" was
its<br>
 name. Yes, they looked very like the wonderful M. Sumichrast of
that<br>
 tale, and very unlike the 'highly unscrupulous folk' of
Hurree<br>
 Babu's imagining. The coolies, earth-coloured and mute,
crouched<br>
 reverently some twenty or thirty yards away, and the Babu, the
slack<br>
 of his thin gear snapping like a marking-flag in the chill
breeze,<br>
 stood by with an air of happy proprietorship.</p>

<p>'These are the men,' Hurree whispered, as the ritual went on
and the<br>
 two whites followed the grass-blade sweeping from Hell to Heaven
and<br>
 back again. 'All their books are in the large kilta with the
reddish<br>
 top - books and reports and maps - and I have seen a King's
letter<br>
 that either Hilas or Bunar has written. They guard it most<br>
 carefully. They have sent nothing back from Hilas or Leh. That
is<br>
 sure.'</p>

<p>'Who is with them?'</p>

<p>'Only the beegar-coolies. They have no servants. They are so
close<br>
 they cook their own food.'</p>

<p>'But what am I to do?'</p>

<p>'Wait and see. Only if any chance comes to me thou wilt know
where<br>
 to seek for the papers.'</p>

<p>'This were better in Mahbub Ali's hands than a Bengali's,'
said Kim<br>
 scornfully.</p>

<p>'There are more ways of getting to a sweetheart than butting
down a<br>
 wall.'</p>

<p>'See here the Hell appointed for avarice and greed. Flanked
upon the<br>
 one side by Desire and on the other by Weariness.' The lama
warmed<br>
 to his work, and one of the strangers sketched him in the
quick-<br>
 fading light.</p>

<p>'That is enough,' the man said at last brusquely. 'I
cannot<br>
 understand him, but I want that picture. He is a better artist
than<br>
 I. Ask him if he will sell it.'</p>

<p>'He says "No, sar,"' the Babu replied. The lama, of course,
would no<br>
 more have parted with his chart to a casual wayfarer than an<br>
 archbishop would pawn the holy vessels of his cathedral. All
Tibet<br>
 is full of cheap reproductions of the Wheel; but the lama was
an<br>
 artist, as well as a wealthy Abbot in his own place.</p>

<p>'Perhaps in three days, or four, or ten, if I perceive that
the<br>
 Sahib is a Seeker and of good understanding, I may myself draw
him<br>
 another. But this was used for the initiation of a novice. Tell
him<br>
 so, hakim.'</p>

<p>'He wishes it now - for money.'</p>

<p>The lama shook his head slowly and began to fold up the Wheel.
The<br>
 Russian, on his side, saw no more than an unclean old man
haggling<br>
 over a dirty piece of paper. He drew out a handful of rupees,
and<br>
 snatched half-jestingly at the chart,which tore in the lama's
grip.<br>
 A low murmur of horror went up from the coolies - some of whom
were<br>
 Spiti men and, by their lights, good Buddhists. The lama rose at
the<br>
 insult; his hand went to the heavy iron pencase that is the
priest's<br>
 weapon,and the Babu danced in agony.</p>

<p>'Now you see - you see why I wanted witnesses. They are
highly<br>
 unscrupulous people. Oh, sar! sar! You must not hit
holyman!'</p>

<p>'Chela! He has defiled the Written Word!'</p>

<p>It was too late. Before Kim could ward him off, the Russian
struck<br>
 the old man full on the face. Next instant he was rolling over
and<br>
 over downhill with Kim at his throat. The blow had waked
every<br>
 unknown Irish devil in the boy's blood, and the sudden fall of
his<br>
 enemy did the rest. The lama dropped to his knees, half-stunned;
the<br>
 coolies under their loads fled up the hill as fast as plainsmen
run<br>
 aross the level. They had seen sacrilege unspeakable, and it
behoved<br>
 them to get away before the Gods and devils of the hills
took<br>
 vengeance. The Frenchman ran towards the lama, fumbling at
his<br>
 revolver with some notion of making him a hostage for his
companion.<br>
 A shower of cutting stones - hillmen are very straight shots -
drove<br>
 him away, and a coolie from Ao-chung snatched the lama into
the<br>
 stampede. All came about as swiftly as the sudden
mountain-darkness.</p>

<p>'They have taken the baggage and all the guns,' yelled the<br>
 Frenchman, firing blindly into the twilight.</p>

<p>'All right, sar! All right! Don't shoot. I go to rescue,'
and<br>
 Hurree, pounding down the slope, cast himself bodily upon
the<br>
 delighted and astonished Kim, who was banging his breathless
foe's<br>
 head against a boulder.</p>

<p>'Go back to the coolies,' whispered the Babu in his ear. 'They
have<br>
 the baggage. The papers are in the kilta with the red top, but
look<br>
 through all. Take their papers, and specially the murasla
[King's<br>
 letter]. Go! The other man comes!'</p>

<p>Kim tore uphill. A revolver-bullet rang on a rock by his side,
and<br>
 he cowered partridge-wise.</p>

<p>'If you shoot,' shouted Hurree, 'they will descend and
annihilate<br>
 us. I have rescued the gentleman, sar. This is particularly<br>
 dangerous.'</p>

<p>'By Jove!' Kim was thinking hard in English. 'This is
dam'-tight<br>
 place, but I think it is self-defence.' He felt in his bosom
for<br>
 Mahbub's gift, and uncertainly - save for a few practice shots
in<br>
 the Bikanir desert, he had never used the little gun -pulled
the<br>
 trigger.</p>

<p>'What did I say, sar!' The Babu seemed to be in tears. 'Come
down<br>
 here and assist to resuscitate. We are all up a tree, I tell
you.'</p>

<p>The shots ceased. There was a sound of stumbling feet, and
Kim<br>
 hurried upward through the gloom, swearing like a cat - or a<br>
 country-bred.</p>

<p>'Did they wound thee, chela?' called the lama above him.</p>

<p>'No. And thou?' He dived into a clump of stunted firs.</p>

<p>'Unhurt. Come away. We go with these folk to
Shamlegh-under-the-<br>
 Snow.'</p>

<p>'But not before we have done justice,' a voice cried. 'I have
got<br>
 the Sahibs' guns - all four. Let us go down.'</p>

<p>'He struck the Holy One - we saw it! Our cattle will be
barren- our<br>
 wives will cease to bear! The snows will slide upon us as we go
home<br>
 ... Atop of all other oppression too!'</p>

<p>The little fir-clump filled with clamouring coolies -
panic-<br>
 stricken, and in their terror capable of anything. The man
from<br>
 Ao-chung clicked the breech-bolt of his gun impatiently, and
made as<br>
 to go downhill.</p>

<p>'Wait a little, Holy One; they cannot go far. Wait till I
return,'<br>
 said he.</p>

<p>'It is this person who has suffered wrong,' said the lama, his
hand<br>
 over his brow.</p>

<p>'For that very reason,' was the reply.</p>

<p>'If this person overlooks it, your hands are clean. Moreover,
ye<br>
 acquire merit by obedience.'</p>

<p>'Wait, and we will all go to Shamlegh together,' the man
insisted.</p>

<p>For a moment, for just so long as it needs to stuff a
cartridge into<br>
 a breech-loader, the lama hesitated. Then he rose to his feet,
and<br>
 laid a finger on the man's shoulder.</p>

<p>'Hast thou heard? I say there shall be no killing - I who was
Abbot<br>
 of Such-zen. Is it any lust of thine to be re-born as a rat,or
a<br>
 snake under the eaves - a worm in the belly of the most mean
beast?<br>
 Is it thy wish to -'</p>

<p>The man from Ao-chung fell to his knees, for the voice boomed
like a<br>
 Tibetan devil-gong.</p>

<p>'Ai! ai!' cried the Spiti men.'Do not curse us - do not curse
him.<br>
 It was but his zeal, Holy One! . . . Put down the rifle,
fool!'</p>

<p>'Anger on anger! Evil on evil! There will be no killing. Let
the<br>
 priest-beaters go in bondage to their own acts. Just and sure is
the<br>
 Wheel, swerving not a hair! They will be born many times -
in<br>
 torment.' His head drooped, and he leaned heavily on Kim's
shoulder.</p>

<p>'I have come near to great evil, chela,' he whispered in that
dead<br>
 hush under the pines. 'I was tempted to loose the bullet; and
truly,<br>
 in Tibet there would have been a heavy and a slow death for them
...<br>
 He struck me across the face ... upon the flesh ...' He slid to
the<br>
 ground, breathing heavily, and Kim could hear the over-driven
heart<br>
 bump and check.</p>

<p>'Have they hurt him to the death?' said the Ao-chung man,
while the<br>
 others stood mute.</p>

<p>Kim knelt over the body in deadly fear. 'Nay,' he cried<br>
 passionately, 'this is only a weakness.' Then he remembered that
he<br>
 was a white man, with a white man's camp-fittings at his
service.<br>
 'Open the kiltas! The Sahibs may have a medicine.'</p>

<p>'Oho! Then I know it,' said the Ao-chung man with a laugh.
'Not for<br>
 five years was I Yankling Sahib's shikarri without knowing
that<br>
 medicine. I too have tasted it. Behold!'</p>

<p>He drew from his breast a bottle of cheap whisky - such as is
sold<br>
 to explorers at Leh - and cleverly forced a little between
the<br>
 lama's teeth.</p>

<p>'So I did when Yankling Sahib twisted his foot beyond Astor.
Aha! I<br>
 have already looked into their baskets - but we will make
fair<br>
 division at Shamlegh. Give him a little more. It is good
medicine.<br>
 Feel! His heart goes better now. Lay his head down and rub a
little<br>
 on the chest. If he had waited quietly while I accounted for
the<br>
 Sahibs this would never have come. But perhaps the Sahibs may
chase<br>
 us here. Then it would not be wrong to shoot them with their
own<br>
 guns, heh?'</p>

<br>
'One is paid, I think, already,' said Kim between his teeth. 'I
<br>
kicked him in the groin as we went downhill. Would I had killed
<br>
him!'

<p>'It is well to be brave when one does not live in Rampur,'
said one<br>
 whose hut lay within a few miles of the Rajah's rickety palace.
'If<br>
 we get a bad name among the Sahibs, none will employ us as
shikarris<br>
 any more.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but these are not Angrezi Sahibs - not merry-minded men
like<br>
 Fostum Sahib or Yankling Sahib. They are foreigners - they
cannot<br>
 speak Angrezi as do Sahibs.'</p>

<p>Here the lama coughed and sat up, groping for the rosary.</p>

<p>'There shall be no killing,' he murmured. 'Just is the Wheel!
Evil<br>
 on evil -'</p>

<p>'Nay, Holy One. We are all here.' The Ao-chung man timidly
patted<br>
 his feet. 'Except by thy order, no one shall be slain. Rest
awhile.<br>
 We will make a little camp here, and later, as the moon rises,
we go<br>
 to Shamlegh-under-the-Snow.'</p>

<p>'After a blow, ' said a Spiti man sententiously, 'it is best
to<br>
 sleep.'</p>

<p>'There is, as it were, a dizziness at the back of my neck, and
a<br>
 pinching in it. Let me lay my head on thy lap, chela. I am an
old<br>
 man, but not free from passion . . . We must think of the Cause
of<br>
 Things.'</p>

<p>'Give him a blanket. We dare not light a fire lest the Sahibs
see.'</p>

<p>'Better get away to Shamlegh. None will follow us to
Shamlegh.'</p>

<p>This was the nervous Rampur man.</p>

<p>'I have been Fostum Sahib's shikarri, and I am Yankling
Sahib's<br>
 shikarri. I should have been with Yankling Sahib now but for
this<br>
 cursed beegar [the corvee]. Let two men watch below with the
guns<br>
 lest the Sahibs do more foolishness. I shall not leave this
Holy<br>
 One.'</p>

<p>They sat down a little apart from the lama, and, after
listening<br>
 awhile, passed round a water-pipe whose receiver was an old Day
and<br>
 Martin blacking-bottle. The glow of the red charcoal as it went
from<br>
 hand to hand lit up the narrow, blinking eyes, the high
Chinese<br>
 cheek-bones, and the bull-throats that melted away into the
dark<br>
 duffle folds round the shoulders. They looked like kobolds from
some<br>
 magic mine - gnomes of the hills in conclave. And while they
talked,<br>
 the voices of the snow-waters round them diminished one by one
as<br>
 the night- frost choked and clogged the runnels.'</p>

<p>'How he stood up against us!' said a Spiti man admiring. 'I
remember<br>
 an old ibex, out Ladakh-way, that Dupont Sahib missed on a
shoulder-<br>
 shot, seven seasons back, standing up just like him. Dupont
Sahib<br>
 was a good shikarri.'</p>

<p>'Not as good as Yankling Sahib.' The Ao-chung man took a pull
at the<br>
 whisky-bottle and passed it over. 'Now hear me - unless any
other<br>
 man thinks he knows more.'</p>

<p>The challenge was not taken up.</p>

<p>'We go to Shamlegh when the moon rises. There we will fairly
divide<br>
 the baggage between us. I am content with this new little rifle
and<br>
 all its cartridges.'</p>

<p>'Are the bears only bad on thy holding? said a mate, sucking
at the<br>
 pipe.</p>

<p>'No; but musk-pods are worth six rupees apiece now, and thy
women<br>
 can have the canvas of the tents and some of the cooking-gear.
We<br>
 will do all that at Shamlegh before dawn. Then we all go our
ways,<br>
 remembering that we have never seen or taken service with
these<br>
 Sahibs, who may, indeed, say that we have stolen their
baggage.'</p>

<p>'That is well for thee, but what will our Rajah say?'</p>

<p>'Who is to tell him? Those Sahibs, who cannot speak our talk,
or<br>
 the Babu, who for his own ends gave us money? Will he lead an
army<br>
 against us? What evidence will remain? That we do not need we
shall<br>
 throw on Shamlegh-midden, where no man has yet set foot.'</p>

<p>'Who is at Shamlegh this summer?' The place was only a grazing
centre<br>
 of three or four huts.</p>

<p>'The Woman of Shamlegh. She has no love for Sahibs, as we
know. The<br>
 others can be pleased with little presents; and here is enough
for<br>
 us all.' He patted the fat sides of the nearest basket.</p>

<p>'But - but -'</p>

<p>'I have said they are not true Sahibs. All their skins and
heads<br>
 were bought in the bazar at Leh. I know the marks. I showed them
to<br>
 ye last march.'</p>

<p>'True. They were all bought skins and heads. Some had even the
moth<br>
 in them.'</p>

<p>That was a shrewd argument, and the Ao-chung man knew his
fellows.</p>

<p>'If the worst comes to the worst, I shall tell Yankling Sahib,
who<br>
 is a man of a merry mind, and he will laugh. We are not doing
any<br>
 wrong to any Sahibs whom we know. They are priest-beaters.
They<br>
 frightened us. We fled! Who knows where we dropped the baggage?
Do<br>
 ye think Yankling Sahib will permit down-country police to
wander<br>
 all over the hills, disturbing his game? It is a far cry from
Simla<br>
 to Chini, and farther from Shamlegh to Shamlegh-midden.'</p>

<p>'So be it, but I carry the big kilta. The basket with the red
top<br>
 that the Sahibs pack themselves every morning.'</p>

<p>'Thus it is proved,' said the Shamlegh man adroitly, 'that
they are<br>
 Sahibs of no account. Who ever heard of Fostum Sahib, or
Yankling<br>
 Sahib, or even the little Peel Sahib that sits up of nights to
shoot<br>
 serow - I say, who, ever heard of these Sahibs coming into the
hills<br>
 without a down-country cook, and a bearer, and - and all manner
of<br>
 well-paid, high-handed and oppressive folk in their tail? How
can<br>
 they make trouble? What of the kilta?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, but that it is full of the Written Word - books and
papers<br>
 in which they wrote, and strange instruments, as of
worship.'</p>

<p>'Shamlegh-midden will take them all.'</p>

<p>'True! But how if we insult the Sahibs' Gods thereby! I do not
like<br>
 to handle the Written Word in that fashion. And their brass
idols<br>
 are beyond my comprehension. It is no plunder for simple
hill-folk.'</p>

<p>'The old man still sleeps. Hst! We will ask his chela.' The
Ao-chung<br>
 man refreshed himself, and swelled with pride of leadership.</p>

<p>'We have here,' he whispered, 'a kilta whose nature we do not
know.'</p>

<p>'But I do,' said Kim cautiously. The lama drew breath in
natural,<br>
 easy sleep, and Kim had been thinking of Hurree's last words. As
a<br>
 player of the Great Game, he was disposed just then to reverence
the<br>
 Babu. 'It is a kilta with a red top full of very wonderful
things,<br>
 not to be handled by fools.'</p>

<p>'I said it; I said it,' cried the bearer of that burden.
'Thinkest<br>
 thou it will betray us?'</p>

<p>'Not if it be given to me. I can draw out its magic. Otherwise
it<br>
 will do great harm.'</p>

<p>'A priest always takes his share.' Whisky was demoralizing the
Ao-<br>
 chung man.</p>

<p>'It is no matter to me.' Kim answered, with the craft of his
mother-<br>
 country. 'Share it among you, and see what comes!'</p>

<p>'Not I. I was only jesting. Give the order. There is more
than<br>
 enough for us all. We go our way from Shamlegh in the dawn.'</p>

<p>They arranged and re-arranged their artless little plans for
another<br>
 hour, while Kim shivered with cold and pride. The humour of
the<br>
 situation tickled the Irish and the Oriental in his soul. Here
were<br>
 the emissaries of the dread Power of the North, very possibly
as<br>
 great in their own land as Mahbub or Colonel Creighton,
suddenly<br>
 smitten helpless. One of them, he privately knew, would be lame
for<br>
 a time. They had made promises to Kings. Tonight they lay
out<br>
 somewhere below him, chartless, foodless, tentless, gunless -
except<br>
 for Hurree Babu, guideless. And this collapse of their Great
Game<br>
 (Kim wondered to whom they would report it), this panicky bolt
into<br>
 the night, had come about through no craft of Hurree's or<br>
 contrivance of Kim's, but simply, beautifully, and inevitably as
the<br>
 capture of Mahbub's fakir-friends by the zealous young policeman
at<br>
 Umballa.</p>

<p>'They are there - with nothing; and, by Jove, it is cold! I am
here<br>
 with all their things. Oh, they will be angry! I am sorry for
Hurree<br>
 Babu.'</p>

<p>Kim might have saved his pity, for though at that moment the
Bengali<br>
 suffered acutely in the flesh, his soul was puffed and lofty. A
mile<br>
 down the hill, on the edge of the pine-forest, two half-frozen
men -<br>
 one powerfully sick at intervals - were varying mutual<br>
 recriminations with the most poignant abuse of the Babu, who
seemed<br>
 distraught with terror. They demanded a plan of action. He<br>
 explained that they were very lucky to be alive; that their
coolies,<br>
 if not then stalking them, had passed beyond recall; that the
Rajah,<br>
 his master, was ninety miles away, and, so far from lending
them<br>
 money and a retinue for the Simla journey, would surely cast
them<br>
 into prison if he heard that they had hit a priest. He enlarged
on<br>
 this sin and its consequences till they bade him change the
subject.<br>
 Their one hope, said he, was unostentatious flight from village
to<br>
 village till they reached civilization; and, for the hundredth
time<br>
 dissolved in tears, he demanded of the high stars why the
Sahibs<br>
 'had beaten holy man'.</p>

<p>Ten steps would have taken Hurree into the creaking gloom
utterly<br>
 beyond their reach - to the shelter and food of the nearest
village,<br>
 where glib-tongued doctors were scarce. But he preferred to
endure<br>
 cold, belly-pinch, bad words, and occasional blows in the
company of<br>
 his honoured employers. Crouched against a tree-trunk, he
sniffed<br>
 dolefully.</p>

<p>'And have you thought,' said the uninjured man hotly, 'what
sort of<br>
 spectacle we shall present wandering through these hills among
these<br>
 aborigines?'</p>

<p>Hurree Babu had thought of little else for some hours, but
the<br>
 remark was not to his address.</p>

<p>'We cannot wander! I can hardly walk,' groaned Kim's
victim.</p>

<p>'Perhaps the holy man will be merciful in loving-kindness,
sar,<br>
 otherwise -'</p>

<p>'I promise myself a peculiar pleasure in emptying my revolver
into<br>
 that young bonze when next we meet,' was the unchristian
answer.</p>

<p>'Revolvers! Vengeance! Bonzes!' Hurree crouched lower. The war
was<br>
 breaking out afresh. 'Have you no consideration for our loss?
The<br>
 baggage! The baggage!' He could hear the speaker literally
dancing<br>
 on the grass. 'Everything we bore! Everything we have secured!
Our<br>
 gains! Eight months' work! Do you know what that means?
"Decidedly<br>
 it is we who can deal with Orientals!" Oh, you have done
well.'</p>

<p>They fell to it in several tongues, and Hurree smiled. Kim was
with<br>
 the kiltas, and in the kiltas lay eight months of good
diplomacy.<br>
 There was no means of communicating with the boy, but he could
be<br>
 trusted. For the rest, Hurree could so stage-manage the
journey<br>
 through the hills that Hilas, Bunar, and four hundred miles of
hill-<br>
 roads should tell the tale for a generation. Men who cannot
control<br>
 their own coolies are little respected in the Hills, and the
hillman<br>
 has a very keen sense of humour.</p>

<p>'If I had done it myself,' thought Hurree, 'it would not have
been<br>
 better; and, by Jove, now I think of it, of course I arranged
it<br>
 myself. How quick I have been! Just when I ran downhill I
thought<br>
 it! Thee outrage was accidental, but onlee me could have worked
it -<br>
 ah - for all it was dam'-well worth. Consider the moral effect
upon<br>
 these ignorant peoples! No treaties - no papers - no written<br>
 documents at all - and me to interpret for them. How I shall
laugh<br>
 with the Colonel! I wish I had their papers also: but you
cannot<br>
 occupy two places in space simultaneously. Thatt is
axiomatic.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><br>
 My brother kneels (so saith Kabir)<br>
 To stone and brass in heathen wise,<br>
 But in my brother's voice I hear<br>
 My own unanswered agonies.<br>
 His God is as his Fates assign -<br>
 His prayer is all the world's - and mine.</p>

<p>The Prayer.</p>

<p><br>
 At moonrise the cautious coolies got under way. The lama,
refreshed<br>
 by his sleep and the spirit, needed no more than Kim's shoulder
to<br>
 bear him along - a silent, swift-striding man. They held the
shale-<br>
 sprinkled grass for an hour, swept round the shoulder of an
immortal<br>
 cliff, and climbed into a new country entirely blocked off from
all<br>
 sight of Chini valley. A huge pasture-ground ran up fan-shaped
to<br>
 the living snow. At its base was perhaps half an acre of flat
land,<br>
 on which stood a few soil and timber huts. Behind them - for,
hill-<br>
 fashion, they were perched on the edge of all things - the
ground<br>
 fell sheer two thousand feet to Shamlegh-midden, where never yet
man<br>
 has set foot.</p>

<p><br>
 The men made no motion to divide the plunder till they had seen
the<br>
 lama bedded down in the best room of the place, with Kim
shampooing<br>
 his feet, Mohammedan-fashion.</p>

<p>'We will send food, ' said the Ao-chung man, 'and the red-
topped<br>
 kilta. By dawn there will be none to give evidence, one way or
the<br>
 other. If anything is not needed in the kilta - see here!'</p>

<p>He pointed through the window - opening into space that was
filled<br>
 with moonlight reflected from the snow - and threw out an
empty<br>
 whisky-bottle.</p>

<p>'No need to listen for the fall. This is the world's end,' he
said,<br>
 and went out. The lama looked forth, a hand on either sill,
with<br>
 eyes that shone like yellow opals. From the enormous pit before
him<br>
 white peaks lifted themselves yearning to the moonlight. The
rest<br>
 was as the darkness of interstellar space.</p>

<p>'These,' he said slowly, 'are indeed my Hills. Thus should a
man<br>
 abide, perched above the world, separated from delights,
considering<br>
 vast matters.'</p>

<p>'Yes; if he has a chela to prepare tea for him, and to fold
a<br>
 blanket for his head, and to chase out calving cows.'</p>

<p>A smoky lamp burned in a niche, but the full moonlight beat it
down;<br>
 and by the mixed light, stooping above the food-bag and cups,
Kim<br>
 moved like a tall ghost.</p>

<p>'Ai! But now I have let the blood cool, my head still beats
and<br>
 drums, and there is a cord round the back of my neck.'</p>

<p>'No wonder. It was a strong blow. May he who dealt it -'</p>

<p>'But for my own passions there would have been no evil.'</p>

<p>'What evil? Thou hast saved the Sahibs from the death they
deserved<br>
 a hundred times.'</p>

<p>'The lesson is not well learnt, chela.' The lama came to rest
on a<br>
 folded blanket, as Kim went forward with his evening routine.
'The<br>
 blow was but a shadow upon a shadow. Evil in itself - my legs
weary<br>
 apace these latter days! - it met evil in me anger, rage, and a
lust<br>
 to return evil. These wrought in my blood, woke tumult in my<br>
 stomach, and dazzled my ears.' Here he drank scalding
block-tea<br>
 ceremonially, taking the hot cup from Kim's hand. 'Had I
been<br>
 passionless, the evil blow would have done only bodily evil -
a<br>
 scar, or a bruise - which is illusion. But my mind was not<br>
 abstracted, for rushed in straightway a lust to let the Spiti
men<br>
 kill. In fighting that lust, my soul was torn and wrenched
beyond a<br>
 thousand blows. Not till I had repeated the Blessings' (he meant
the<br>
 Buddhist Beatitudes) 'did I achieve calm. But the evil planted
in<br>
 me by that moment's carelessness works out to its end. Just is
the<br>
 Wheel, swerving not a hair! Learn the lesson, chela.'</p>

<p>'It is too high for me,' Kim muttered. 'I am still all shaken.
I am<br>
 glad I hurt the man.'</p>

<p>'I felt that, sleeping upon thy knees, in the wood below.
It<br>
 disquieted me in my dreams - the evil in thy soul working
through to<br>
 mine. Yet on the other hand' - he loosed his rosary -'I have<br>
 acquired merit by saving two lives - the lives of those that
wronged<br>
 me. Now I must see into the Cause of Things.The boat of my
soul<br>
 staggers.'</p>

<p>'Sleep, and be strong. That is wisest.'</p>

<p>'I meditate. There is a need greater than thou knowest.'</p>

<p>Till the dawn, hour after hour, as the moonlight paled on the
high<br>
 peaks, and that which had been belted blackness on the sides of
the<br>
 far hills showed as tender green forest, the lama stared fixedly
at<br>
 the wall. From time to time he groaned. Outside the barred
door,<br>
 where discomfited kine came to ask for their old stable,
Shamlegh<br>
 and the coolies gave itself up to plunder and riotous living.
The<br>
 Ao-chung man was their leader, and once they had opened the
Sahibs'<br>
 tinned foods and found that they were very good they dared not
turn<br>
 back. Shamlegh kitchen-midden took the dunnage.</p>

<p>When Kim, after a night of bad dreams, stole forth to brush
his<br>
 teeth in the morning chill, a fair-coloured woman with
turquoise-<br>
 studded headgear drew him aside.</p>

<p>'The others have gone. They left thee this kilta as the
promise was.<br>
 I do not love Sahibs, but thou wilt make us a charm in return
for<br>
 it. We do not wish little Shamlegh to get a bad name on account
of<br>
 the - accident. I am the Woman of Shamlegh.' She looked him
over<br>
 with bold, bright eyes, unlike the usual furtive glance of<br>
 hillwomen.</p>

<p>'Assuredly. But it must be done in secret.'</p>

<p>She raised the heavy kilta like a toy and slung it into her
own hut.</p>

<p>'Out and bar the door! Let none come near till it is
finished,'<br>
 said Kim.</p>

<p>'But afterwards - we may talk?'</p>

<p>Kim tilted the kilta on the floor - a cascade of
Survey-instruments,<br>
 books, diaries, letters, maps, and queerly scented native<br>
 correspondence. At the very bottom was an embroidered bag
covering a<br>
 sealed, gilded, and illuminated document such as one King sends
to<br>
 another. Kim caught his breath with delight,and reviewed the<br>
 situation from a Sahib's point of view.</p>

<p>'The books I do not want. Besides, they are logarithms -
Survey, I<br>
 suppose.' He laid them aside. 'The letters I do not understand,
but<br>
 Colonel Creighton will. They must all be kept. The maps - they
draw<br>
 better maps than me - of course. All the native letters - oho! -
and<br>
 particularly the murasla.' He sniffed the embroidered bag.
'That<br>
 must be from Hilas or Bunar, and Hurree Babu spoke truth. By
Jove!<br>
 It is a fine haul. I wish Hurree could know . . . The rest must
go<br>
 out of the window.' He fingered a superb prismatic compass and
the<br>
 shiny top of a theodolite. But after all, a Sahib cannot very
well<br>
 steal, and the things might be inconvenient evidence later.
He<br>
 sorted out every scrap of manuscript, every map, and the
native<br>
 letters. They made one softish slab. The three locked
ferril-backed<br>
 books, with five worn pocket-books, he put aside.</p>

<p>'The letters and the murasla I must carry inside my coat and
under<br>
 my belt, and the hand-written books I must put into the
food-bag. It<br>
 will be very heavy. No. I do not think there is anything more.
If<br>
 there is, the coolies have thrown it down the khud, so thatt is
all<br>
 right. Now you go too.' He repacked the kilta with all he meant
to<br>
 lose, and hove it up on to the windowsill. A thousand feet below
lay<br>
 a long, lazy, round-shouldered bank of mist, as yet untouched by
the<br>
 morning sun. A thousand feet below that was a hundred-year-old
pine-<br>
 forest. He could see the green tops looking like a bed of moss
when<br>
 a wind-eddy thinned the cloud.</p>

<p>'No! I don't think any one will go after you!'</p>

<p>The wheeling basket vomited its contents as it dropped.
The<br>
 theodolite hit a jutting cliff-ledge and exploded like a shell;
the<br>
 books, inkstands, paint-boxes, compasses, and rulers showed for
a<br>
 few seconds like a swarm of bees. Then they vanished; and,
though<br>
 Kim, hanging half out of the window, strained his young ears,
never<br>
 a sound came up from the gulf.</p>

<p>'Five hundred - a thousand rupees could not buy them,' he
thought<br>
 sorrowfully. 'It was verree wasteful, but I have all their
other<br>
 stuff - everything they did - I hope. Now how the deuce am I to
tell<br>
 Hurree Babu, and whatt the deuce am I to do? And my old man is
sick.<br>
 I must tie up the letters in oilskin. That is something to do
first<br>
 - else they will get all sweated ... And I am all alone!' He
bound<br>
 them into a neat packet, swedging down the stiff, sticky oilskin
at<br>
 the comers, for his roving life had made him as methodical as an
old<br>
 hunter in matters of the road. Then with double care he packed
away<br>
 the books at the bottom of the food-bag.</p>

<p>The woman rapped at the door.</p>

<p>'But thou hast made no charm,' she said, looking about.</p>

<p>'There is no need.' Kim had completely overlooked the
necessity for<br>
 a little patter-talk. The woman laughed at his confusion<br>
 irreverently.</p>

<p>'None - for thee. Thou canst cast a spell by the mere winking
of an<br>
 eye. But think of us poor people when thou art gone. They were
all<br>
 too drunk last night to hear a woman. Thou art not drunk?'</p>

<p>'I am a priest.' Kim had recovered himself, and, the woman
being<br>
 aught but unlovely, thought best to stand on his office.</p>

<p>'I warned them that the Sahibs will be angry and will make
an<br>
 inquisition and a report to the Rajah. There is also the Babu
with<br>
 them. Clerks have long tongues.'</p>

<p>'Is that all thy trouble?' The plan rose fully formed in Kim's
mind,<br>
 and he smiled ravishingly.</p>

<p>'Not all,' quoth the woman, putting out a hard brown hand
all<br>
 covered with turquoises set in silver.</p>

<p>'I can finish that in a breath,' he went on quickly. 'The Babu
is<br>
 the very hakim (thou hast heard of him?) who was wandering among
the<br>
 hills by Ziglaur. I know him.'</p>

<p>'He will tell for the sake of a reward. Sahibs cannot
distinguish<br>
 one hillman from another, but Babus have eyes for men - and
women.'</p>

<p>'Carry a word to him from me.'</p>

<p>'There is nothing I would not do for thee.'</p>

<p>He accepted the compliment calmly, as men must in lands where
women<br>
 make the love, tore a leaf from a note-book, and with a
patent<br>
 indelible pencil wrote in gross Shikast - the script that bad
little<br>
 boys use when they write dirt on walls: 'I have everything that
they<br>
 have written: their pictures of the country, and many
letters.<br>
 Especially the murasla. Tell me what to do. I am at
Shamlegh-under-<br>
 the-Snow. The old man is sick.'</p>

<p>"Take this to him. It will altogether shut his mouth. He
cannot have<br>
 gone far.'</p>

<p>'Indeed no. They are still in the forest across the spur.
Our<br>
 children went to watch them when the light came, and have cried
the<br>
 news as they moved.'</p>

<p>Kim looked his astonishment; but from the edge of the
sheep-pasture<br>
 floated a shrill, kite-like trill. A child tending cattle had
picked<br>
 it up from a brother or sister on the far side of the slope
that<br>
 commanded Chini valley,</p>

<p>'My husbands are also out there gathering wood.' She drew a
handful<br>
 of walnuts from her bosom, split one neatly, and began to eat.
Kim<br>
 affected blank ignorance.</p>

<p>'Dost thou not know the meaning of the walnut -- priest?' she
said<br>
 coyly, and handed him the half-shells.</p>

<p>'Well thought of.' He slipped the piece of paper between
them<br>
 quickly. 'Hast thou a little wax to close them on this
letter?'</p>

<p>The woman sighed aloud, and Kim relented.</p>

<p>'There is no payment till service has been rendered. Carry
this to<br>
 the Babu, and say it was sent by the Son of the Charm.'</p>

<p>'Al! Truly! Truly! By a magician - who is like a Sahib.'</p>

<p>'Nay, a Son of the Charm: and ask if there be any answer.'</p>

<p>'But if he offer a rudeness? I - I am afraid.'</p>

<p>Kim laughed. 'He is, I have no doubt, very tired and very
hungry.<br>
 The Hills make cold bedfellows. Hai, my' - it was on the tip of
his<br>
 tongue to say Mother, but he turned it to Sister -'thou art a
wise<br>
 and witty woman. By this time all the villages know what has<br>
 befallen the Sahibs - eh?'</p>

<p>'True. News was at Ziglaur by midnight, and by tomorrow should
be at<br>
 Kotgarh. The villages are both afraid and angry.'</p>

<p>'No need. Tell the villages to feed the Sahibs and pass them
on, in<br>
 peace. We must get them quietly away from our valleys. To steal
is<br>
 one thing - to kill another. The Babu will understand, and
there<br>
 will be no after-complaints. Be swift. I must tend my master
when he<br>
 wakes.'</p>

<p>'So be it. After service - thou hast said? - comes the reward.
I am<br>
 the Woman of Shamlegh, and I hold from the Rajah. I am no
common<br>
 bearer of babes. Shamlegh is thine: hoof and horn and hide, milk
and<br>
 butter. Take or leave.'</p>

<p>She turned resolutely uphill, her silver necklaces clicking on
her<br>
 broad breast, to meet the morning sun fifteen hundred feet
above<br>
 them. This time Kim thought in the vernacular as he waxed down
the<br>
 oilskin edges of the packets.</p>

<p>'How can a man follow the Way or the Great Game when he is
so-always<br>
 pestered by women? There was that girl at Akrola of the Ford;
and<br>
 there was the scullion's wife behind the dovecot - not counting
the<br>
 others - and now comes this one! When I was a child it was
well<br>
 enough, but now I am a man and they will not regard me as a
man.<br>
 Walnuts, indeed! Ho! ho! It is almonds in the Plains!'</p>

<p>He went out to levy on the village - not with a begging-bowl,
which<br>
 might do for down-country, but in the manner of a prince.
Shamlegh's<br>
 summer population is only three families - four women and eight
or<br>
 nine men. They were all full of tinned meats and mixed drinks,
from<br>
 ammoniated quinine to white vodka, for they had taken their
full<br>
 share in the overnight loot. The neat Continental tents had been
cut<br>
 up and shared long ago, and there were patent aluminium
saucepans<br>
 abroad.</p>

<p>But they considered the lama's presence a perfect safeguard
against<br>
 all consequences, and impenitently brought Kim of their best -
even<br>
 to a drink of chang - the barley-beer that comes from
Ladakh-way.<br>
 Then they thawed out in the sun, and sat with their legs
hanging<br>
 over infinite abysses, chattering, laughing, and smoking.
They<br>
 judged India and its Government solely from their experience
of<br>
 wandering Sahibs who had employed them or their friends as<br>
 shikarris. Kim heard tales of shots missed upon ibex, serow,
or<br>
 markhor, by Sahibs twenty years in their graves - every
detail<br>
 lighted from behind like twigs on tree-tops seen against
lightning.<br>
 They told him of their little diseases, and, more important,
the<br>
 diseases of their tiny, sure-footed cattle; of trips as far
as<br>
 Kotgarh, where the strange missionaries live, and beyond even
to<br>
 marvellous Simla, where the streets are paved with silver,
and<br>
 anyone, look you, can get service with the Sahibs, who ride
about in<br>
 two-wheeled carts and spend money with a spade. Presently,
grave<br>
 and aloof, walking very heavily, the lama joined himself to
the<br>
 chatter under the eaves, and they gave him great room. The thin
air<br>
 refreshed him, and he sat on the edge of precipices with the
best of<br>
 them, and, when talk languished, flung pebbles into the void.
Thirty<br>
 miles away, as the eagle flies, lay the next range, seamed
and<br>
 channelled and pitted with little patches of brush - forests,
each a<br>
 day's dark march. Behind the village, Shamlegh hill itself cut
off<br>
 all view to southward. It was like sitting in a swallow's
nest<br>
 under the eaves of the roof of the world.</p>

<p>&gt;From time to time the lama stretched out his hand, and
with a little<br>
 low-voiced prompting would point out the road to Spiti and
north<br>
 across the Parungla.</p>

<p>'Beyond, where the hills lie thickest, lies De-ch'en' (he
meant<br>
 Han-le'), 'the great Monastery. s'Tag-stan-ras-ch'en built
it,and of<br>
 him there runs this tale.' Whereupon he told it: a fantastic
piled<br>
 narrative of bewitchment and miracles that set Shamlegh
a-gasping.<br>
 Turning west a little, he speered for the green hills of Kulu,
and<br>
 sought Kailung under the glaciers.'For thither came I in the
old,<br>
 old days. From Leh I came, over the Baralachi.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; we know it,' said the far-faring people of
Shamlegh.</p>

<p>'And I slept two nights with the priests of Kailung. These are
the<br>
 Hills of my delight! Shadows blessed above all other shadows!
There<br>
 my eyes opened on this world; there my eyes were opened to
this<br>
 world; there I found Enlightenment; and there I girt my loins
for my<br>
 Search. Out of the Hills I came - the high Hills and the
strong<br>
 winds. Oh, just is the Wheel!' He blessed them in detail - the
great<br>
 glaciers, the naked rocks, the piled moraines and tumbled shale;
dry<br>
 upland, hidden salt-lake, age-old timber and fruitful
water-shot<br>
 valley one after the other, as a dying man blesses his folk; and
Kim<br>
 marvelled at his passion.</p>

<p>'Yes - yes. There is no place like our Hills,' said the people
of<br>
 Shamlegh. And they fell to wondering how a man could live in the
hot<br>
 terrible Plains where the cattle run as big as elephants, unfit
to<br>
 plough on a hillside; where village touches village, they had
heard,<br>
 for a hundred miles; where folk went about stealing in gangs,
and<br>
 what the robbers spared the Police carried utterly away.</p>

<p>So the still forenoon wore through, and at the end of it
Kim's<br>
 messenger dropped from the steep pasture as unbreathed as when
she<br>
 had set out.</p>

<p>'I sent a word to the hakim,' Kim explained, while she
made<br>
 reverence.</p>

<p>'He joined himself to the idolaters? Nay, I remember he did
a<br>
 healing upon one of them. He has acquired merit, though the
healed<br>
 employed his strength for evil. Just is the Wheel! What of
the<br>
 hakim?'</p>

<p>'I feared that thou hadst been bruised and - and I knew he
was<br>
 wise.' Kim took the waxed walnut-shell and read in English on
the<br>
 back of his note: Your favour received. Cannot get away from
present<br>
 company at present, but shall take them into Simla. After
which,<br>
 hope to rejoin you. Inexpedient to follow angry gentlemen.
Return by<br>
 same road you came, and will overtake. Highly gratified
about<br>
 correspondence due to my forethought. 'He says, Holy One, that
he<br>
 will escape from the idolaters, and will return to us. Shall we
wait<br>
 awhile at Shamlegh, then?'</p>

<p>The lama looked long and lovingly upon the hills and shook his
head.</p>

<p>'That may not be, chela. From my bones outward I do desire it,
but<br>
 it is forbidden. I have seen the Cause of Things.'</p>

<p>'Why? When the Hills give thee back thy strength day by
day?<br>
 Remember we were weak and fainting down below there in the
Doon.'</p>

<p>'I became strong to do evil and to forget. A brawler and a<br>
 swashbuckler upon the hillsides was I.' Kim bit back a smile.
'Just<br>
 and perfect is the Wheel, swerving not a hair. When I was a man
- a<br>
 long time ago - I did pilgrimage to Guru Ch'wan among the
poplars'<br>
 (he pointed Bhotanwards), 'where they keep the Sacred
Horse.'</p>

<br>
'Quiet, be quiet!' said Shamlegh, all arow. 'He speaks of
Jam-lin-<br>
nin-k'or, the Horse That Can Go Round The World In a Day.'

<p>'I speak to my chela only,' said the lama, in gentle reproof,
and<br>
 they scattered like frost on south eaves of a morning. 'I did
not<br>
 seek truth in those days, but the talk of doctrine. All
illusion! I<br>
 drank the beer and ate the bread of Guru Ch'wan. Next day one
said:<br>
 "We go out to fight Sangor Gutok down the valley to discover"
(mark<br>
 again how Lust is tied to Anger!) "which Abbot shall bear rule
in<br>
 the valley and take the profit of the prayers they print at
Sangor<br>
 Gutok." I went, and we fought a day.'</p>

<p>'But how, Holy One?'</p>

<p>'With our long pencases as I could have shown . . . I say,
we<br>
 fought under the poplars, both Abbots and all the monks, and
one<br>
 laid open my forehead to the bone. See!' He tilted back his cap
and<br>
 showed a puckered silvery scar. 'Just and perfect is the
Wheel!<br>
 Yesterday the scar itched, and after fifty years I recalled how
it<br>
 was dealt and the face of him who dealt it; dwelling a little
in<br>
 illusion. Followed that which thou didst see - strife and
stupidity.<br>
 Just is the Wheel! The idolater's blow fell upon the scar. Then
I<br>
 was shaken in my soul: my soul was darkened, and the boat of my
soul<br>
 rocked upon the waters of illusion. Not till I came to
Shamlegh<br>
 could I meditate upon the Cause of Things, or trace the
running<br>
 grass-roots of Evil. I strove all the long night.'</p>

<p>'But', Holy One, thou art innocent of all evil. May I be
thy<br>
 sacrifice!'</p>

<p>Kim was genuinely distressed at the old man's sorrow, and
Mahbub<br>
 Ali's phrase slipped out unawares.</p>

<p>'In the dawn,' the lama went on more gravely, ready rosary
clicking<br>
 between the slow sentences, 'came enlightenment. It is here ...
I am<br>
 an old man . . . hill-bred, hill-fed, never to sit down among
my<br>
 Hills. Three years I travelled through Hind, but - can earth
be<br>
 stronger than Mother Earth? My stupid body yearned to the Hills
and<br>
 the snows of the Hills, from below there. I said, and it is
true,<br>
 my Search is sure. So, at the Kulu woman's house I turned
hillward,<br>
 over-persuaded by myself. There is no blame to the hakim. He
-<br>
 following Desire - foretold that the Hills would make me
strong.<br>
 They strengthened me to do evil, to forget my Search. I
delighted in<br>
 life and the lust of life. I desired strong slopes to climb. I
cast<br>
 about to find them. I measured the strength of my body, which
is<br>
 evil, against the high Hills, I made a mock of thee when thy
breath<br>
 came short under Jamnotri. I jested when thou wouldst not face
the<br>
 snow of the pass.'</p>

<p>'But what harm? I was afraid. It was just. I am not a hillman;
and I<br>
 loved thee for thy new strength.'</p>

<p>'More than once I remember' - he rested his cheek dolefully on
his<br>
 hand - 'I sought thy praise and the hakim's for the mere
strength of<br>
 my legs. Thus evil followed evil till the cup was full. Just is
the<br>
 Wheel! All Hind for three years did me all honour. From the
Fountain<br>
 of Wisdom in the Wonder House to' - he smiled -'a little
child<br>
 playing by a big gun - the world prepared my road. And why?'</p>

<p>'Because we loved thee. It is only the fever of the blow. I
myself<br>
 am still sick and shaken.'</p>

<p>'No! It was because I was upon the Way - tuned as are
si-nen<br>
 [cymbals] to the purpose of the Law. I departed from that
ordinance.<br>
 The tune was broken: followed the punishment. In my own Hills,
on<br>
 the edge of my own country, in the very place of my evil
desire,<br>
 comes the buffet - here!' (He touched his brow.) 'As a novice
is<br>
 beaten when he misplaces the cups, so am I beaten, who was Abbot
of<br>
 Such-zen. No word, look you, but a blow, chela.'</p>

<p>'But the Sahibs did not know thee, Holy One?'</p>

<p>'We were well matched. Ignorance and Lust met Ignorance and
Lust<br>
 upon the road, and they begat Anger. The blow was a sign to me,
who<br>
 am no better than a strayed yak, that my place is not here. Who
can<br>
 read the Cause of an act is halfway to Freedom! "Back to the
path,"<br>
 says the Blow. "The Hills are not for thee. Thou canst not
choose<br>
 Freedom and go in bondage to the delight of life."'</p>

<p>'Would we had never met that cursed Russian!'</p>

<p>'Our Lord Himself cannot make the Wheel swing backward. And
for my<br>
 merit that I had acquired I gain yet another sign.' He put his
hand<br>
 in his bosom, and drew forth the Wheel of Life. 'Look! I
considered<br>
 this after I had meditated. There remains untorn by the idolater
no<br>
 more than the breadth of my fingernail.'</p>

<p>'I see.'</p>

<p>'So much, then, is the span of my life in this body. I have
served<br>
 the Wheel all my days. Now the Wheel serves me. But for the
merit I<br>
 have acquired in guiding thee upon the Way, there would have
been<br>
 added to me yet another life ere I had found my River. Is it
plain,<br>
 chela?'</p>

<p>Kim stared at the brutally disfigured chart. From left to
right<br>
 diagonally the rent ran - from the Eleventh House where Desire
gives<br>
 birth to the Child (as it is drawn by Tibetans) - across the
human<br>
 and animal worlds, to the Fifth House - the empty House of
the<br>
 Senses. The logic was unanswerable.</p>

<p>'Before our Lord won Enlightenment' - the lama folded all away
with<br>
 reverence - 'He was tempted. I too have been tempted, but it
is<br>
 finished. The Arrow fell in the Plains - not in the Hills.<br>
 Therefore, what make we here?'</p>

<p>'Shall we at least wait for the hakim?'</p>

<p>'I know how long I shall live in this body. What can a hakim
do?'</p>

<p>'But thou art all sick and shaken. Thou canst not walk.'</p>

<p>'How can I be sick if I see Freedom?' He rose unsteadily to
his<br>
 feet.</p>

<p>'Then I must get food from the village. Oh, the weary Road!'
Kim<br>
 felt that he too needed rest.</p>

<p>'That is lawful. Let us eat and go. he Arrow fell in the
Plains ...<br>
 but I yielded to Desire. Make ready, chela.'</p>

<p>Kim turned to the woman with the turquoise headgear who had
been<br>
 idly pitching pebbles over the cliff. She smiled very
kindly.</p>

<p>'I found him like a strayed buffalo in a cornfield - the
Babu;<br>
 snorting and sneezing with cold. He was so hungry that he forgot
his<br>
 dignity and gave me sweet words. The Sahibs have nothing.' She
flung<br>
 out an empty palm. 'One is very sick about the stomach. Thy
work?'</p>

<p>Kim nodded, with a bright eye.</p>

<p>'I spoke to the Bengali first - and to the people of a
near-by<br>
 village after. The Sahibs will be given food as they need it -
nor<br>
 will the people ask money. The plunder is already distributed.
The<br>
 Babu makes lying speeches to the Sahibs. Why does he not
leave<br>
 them?'</p>

<p>'Out of the greatness of his heart.'</p>

<p>"Was never a Bengali yet had one bigger than a dried walnut.
But it<br>
 is no matter ... Now as to walnuts. After service comes reward.
I<br>
 have said the village is thine.'</p>

<p>'It is my loss,' Kim began. 'Even now I had planned desirable
things<br>
 in my heart which' - there is no need to go through the
compliments<br>
 proper to these occasions. He sighed deeply . . . 'But my
master,<br>
 led by a vision -'</p>

<p>'Huh! What can old eyes see except a full begging-bowl?'</p>

<p>'- turns from this village to the Plains again.'</p>

<p>'Bid him stay.'</p>

<p>Kim shook his head. 'I know my Holy One, and his rage if he
be<br>
 crossed,' he replied impressively. 'His curses shake the
Hills.'</p>

<p>'Pity they did not save him from a broken head! I heard that
thou<br>
 wast the tiger-hearted one who smote the Sahib. Let him dream
a<br>
 little longer. Stay!'</p>

<p>'Hillwoman,' said Kim, with austerity that could not harden
the<br>
 outlines of his young oval face, 'these matters are too high
for<br>
 thee.'</p>

<p>'The Gods be good to us! Since when have men and women been
other<br>
 than men and women?'</p>

<p>'A priest is a priest. He says he will go upon this hour. I am
his<br>
 chela, and I go with him. We need food for the Road. He is
an<br>
 honoured guest in all the villages, but' - he broke into a
pure<br>
 boy's grin - 'the food here is good. Give me some.'</p>

<p>'What if I do not give it thee? I am the woman of this
village.'</p>

<p>'Then I curse thee - a little - not greatly, but enough to<br>
 remember.' He could not help smiling.</p>

<p>'Thou hast cursed me already by the down-dropped eyelash and
the<br>
 uplifted chin. Curses? What should I care for mere words?'
She<br>
 clenched her hands upon her bosom . . . 'But I would not have
thee<br>
 to go in anger, thinking hardly of me - a gatherer of cow-dung
and<br>
 grass at Shamlegh, but still a woman of substance.'</p>

<p>'I think nothing,' said Kim, 'but that I am grieved to go, for
I am<br>
 very weary; and that we need food. Here is the bag.'</p>

<p>The woman snatched it angrily. 'I was foolish,' said she. 'Who
is<br>
 thy woman in the Plains? Fair or black? I was fair once.
Laughest<br>
 thou? Once, long ago, if thou canst believe, a Sahib looked on
me<br>
 with favour. Once, long ago, I wore European clothes at the
Mission-<br>
 house yonder.' She pointed towards Kotgarh. 'Once, long ago. I
was<br>
 Ker-lis-ti-an and spoke English - as the Sahibs speak it. Yes.
My<br>
 Sahib said he would return and wed me - yes, wed me. He went
away -<br>
 I had nursed him when he was sick - but he never returned. Then
I<br>
 saw that the Gods of the Kerlistians lied, and I went back to my
own<br>
 people . . . I have never set eyes on a Sahib since. (Do not
laugh<br>
 at me. The fit is past, little priestling.) Thy face and thy
walk<br>
 and thy fashion of speech put me in mind of my Sahib, though
thou<br>
 art only a wandering mendicant to whom I give a dole. Curse me?
Thou<br>
 canst neither curse nor bless!' She set her hands on her hips
and<br>
 laughed bitterly. 'Thy Gods are lies; thy works are lies; thy
words<br>
 are lies. There are no Gods under all the Heavens. I know it ...
But<br>
 for awhile I thought it was my Sahib come back, and he was my
God.<br>
 Yes, once I made music on a pianno in the Mission-house at
Kotgarh.<br>
 Now I give alms to priests who are heatthen.' She wound up with
the<br>
 English word, and tied the mouth of the brimming bag.</p>

<p>'I wait for thee, chela, ' said the lama, leaning against the
door-<br>
 post.</p>

<p>The woman swept the tall figure with her eyes. 'He walk! He
cannot<br>
 cover half a mile. Whither would old bones go?'</p>

<p>At this Kim, already perplexed by the lama's collapse and
foreseeing<br>
 the weight of the bag, fairly lost his temper.</p>

<p>'What is it to thee, woman of ill-omen, where he goes?'</p>

<p>'Nothing - but something to thee, priest with a Sahib's face.
Wilt<br>
 thou carry him on thy shoulders?'</p>

<p>'I go to the Plains. None must hinder my return. I have
wrestled<br>
 with my soul till I am strengthless. The stupid body is spent,
and<br>
 we are far from the Plains.'</p>

<p>'Behold!' she said simply, and drew aside to let Kim see his
own<br>
 utter helplessness. 'Curse me. Maybe it will give him strength.
Make<br>
 a charm! Call on thy great God. Thou art a priest.' She turned
away.</p>

<p>The lama had squatted limply, still holding by the door-post.
One<br>
 cannot strike down an old man that he recovers again like a boy
in<br>
 the night. Weakness bowed him to the earth, but his eyes that
hung<br>
 on Kim were alive and imploring.</p>

<p>'It is all well,' said Kim. 'It is the thin air that weakens
thee.<br>
 In a little while we go! It is the mountain-sickness. I too am
a<br>
 little sick at stomach,' ... and he knelt and comforted with
such<br>
 poor words as came first to his lips. Then the woman returned,
more<br>
 erect than ever.</p>

<p>'Thy Gods useless, heh? Try mine. I am the Woman of Shamlegh.'
She<br>
 hailed hoarsely, and there came out of a cow-pen her two
husbands<br>
 and three others with a dooli, the rude native litter of the
Hills,<br>
 that they use for carrying the sick and for visits of state.
'These<br>
 cattle' - she did not condescend to look at them - 'are thine
for so<br>
 long as thou shalt need.'</p>

<p>'But we will not go Simla-way. We will not go near the
Sahibs,'<br>
 cried the first husband.</p>

<p>'They will not run away as the others did, nor will they
steal<br>
 baggage. Two I know for weaklings. Stand to the rear-pole, Sonoo
and<br>
 Taree.' They obeyed swiftly. 'Lower now, and lift in that holy
man.<br>
 I will see to the village and your virtuous wives till ye
return.'</p>

<p>'When will that be?'</p>

<p>'Ask the priests. Do not pester me. Lay the food-bag at the
foot, it<br>
 balances better so.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Holy One, thy Hills are kinder than our Plains!' cried
Kim,<br>
 relieved, as the lama tottered to the litter. 'It is a very
king's<br>
 bed - a place of honour and ease. And we owe it to -'</p>

<p>'A woman of ill-omen. I need thy blessings as much as I do
thy<br>
 curses. It is my order and none of thine. Lift and away! Here!
Hast<br>
 thou money for the road?'</p>

<p>She beckoned Kim to her hut, and stooped above a battered
English<br>
 cash-box under her cot.</p>

<p>'I do not need anything,' said Kim, angered where he should
have<br>
 been grateful. 'I am already rudely loaded with favours.'</p>

<p>She looked up with a curious smile and laid a hand on his
shoulder.<br>
 'At least, thank me. I am foul-faced and a hillwoman, but, as
thy<br>
 talk goes, I have acquired merit. Shall I show thee how the
Sahibs<br>
 render thanks?' and her hard eyes softened.</p>

<p>'I am but a wandering priest,' said Kim, his eyes lighting
in<br>
 answer. 'Thou needest neither my blessings nor my curses.'</p>

<p>'Nay. But for one little moment - thou canst overtake the
dooli in<br>
 ten strides - if thou wast a Sahib, shall I show thee what
thou<br>
 wouldst do?' -</p>

<p>'How if I guess, though?' said Kim, and putting his arm round
her<br>
 waist, he kissed her on the cheek, adding in English: 'Thank
you<br>
 verree much, my dear.'</p>

<p>Kissing is practically unknown among Asiatics, which may have
been<br>
 the reason that she leaned back with wide-open eyes and a face
of<br>
 panic.</p>

<p>'Next time,' Kim went on, 'you must not be so sure of your
heatthen<br>
 priests. Now I say good-bye.' He held out his hand
English-fashion.<br>
 She took it mechanically. 'Good-bye, my dear.'</p>

<p>'Good-bye, and - and' - she was remembering her English words
one by<br>
 one -'you will come back again? Good-bye, and - thee God bless
you.'</p>

<p>Half an hour later, as the creaking litter jolted up the hill
path<br>
 that leads south-easterly from Shamlegh, Kim saw a tiny figure
at<br>
 the hut door waving a white rag.</p>

<p>'She has acquired merit beyond all others,' said the lama.
'For to<br>
 set a man upon the way to Freedom is half as great as though she
had<br>
 herself found it.'</p>

<p>'Umm,' said Kim thoughtfully, considering the past. 'It may be
that<br>
 I have acquired merit also ... At least she did not treat me
like a<br>
 child.' He hitched the front of his robe, where lay the slab
of<br>
 documents and maps, re-stowed the precious food-bag at the
lama's<br>
 feet, laid his hand on the litter's edge, and buckled down to
the<br>
 slow pace of the grunting husbands.</p>

<p>'These also acquire merit,' said the lama after three
miles.</p>

<p>'More than that, they shall be paid in silver,' quoth Kim. The
Woman<br>
 of Shamlegh had given it to him; and it was only fair, he
argued,<br>
 that her men should earn it back again.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><br>
 I'd not give room for an Emperor -<br>
 I'd hold my road for a King.<br>
 To the Triple Crown I'd not bow down -<br>
 But this is a different thing!<br>
 I'll not fight with the Powers of Air -<br>
 Sentry, pass him through!<br>
 Drawbridge let fall - He's the Lord of us all -<br>
 The Dreamer whose dream came true!</p>

<p>The Siege of the Fairies.</p>

<p><br>
 Two hundred miles north of Chini, on the blue shale of Ladakh,
lies<br>
 Yankling Sahib, the merry-minded man, spy-glassing wrathfully
across<br>
 the ridges for some sign of his pet tracker - a man from
Ao-chung.<br>
 But that renegade, with a new Mannlicher rifle and two
hundred<br>
 cartridges, is elsewhere, shooting musk-deer for the market,
and<br>
 Yankling Sahib will learn next season how very ill he has
been.</p>

<p><br>
 Up the valleys of Bushahr - the far-beholding eagles of the<br>
 Himalayas swerve at his new blue-and-white gored umbrella -
hurries<br>
 a Bengali, once fat and well-looking, now lean and weather-worn.
He<br>
 has received the thanks of two foreigners of distinction,
piloted<br>
 not unskilfully to Mashobra tunnel, which leads to the great and
gay<br>
 capital of India. It was not his fault that, blanketed by wet
mists,<br>
 he conveyed them past the telegraph-station and European colony
of<br>
 Kotgarh. It was not his fault, but that of the Gods, of whom
he<br>
 discoursed so engagingly, that he led them into the borders
of<br>
 Nahan, where the Rahah of that State mistook them for
deserting<br>
 British soldiery. Hurree Babu explained the greatness and glory,
in<br>
 their own country, of his companions, till the drowsy
kinglet<br>
 smiled. He explained it to everyone who asked - many times -
aloud -<br>
 variously. He begged food, arranged accommodation, proved a
skilful<br>
 leech for an injury of the groin - such a blow as one may
receive<br>
 rolling down a rock-covered hillside in the dark - and in all
things<br>
 indispensable. The reason of his friendliness did him credit.
With<br>
 millions of fellow-serfs, he had learned to look upon Russia as
the<br>
 great deliverer from the North. He was a fearful man. He had
been<br>
 afraid that he could not save his illustrious employers from
the<br>
 anger of an excited peasantry. He himself would just as lief hit
a<br>
 holy man as not, but ... He was deeply grateful and
sincerely<br>
 rejoiced that he had done his 'little possible' towards
bringing<br>
 their venture to - barring the lost baggage - a successful
issue, he<br>
 had forgotten the blows; denied that any blows had been dealt
that<br>
 unseemly first night under the pines. He asked neither pension
nor<br>
 retaining fee, but, if they deemed him worthy, would they write
him<br>
 a testimonial? It might be useful to him later, if others,
their<br>
 friends, came over the Passes. He begged them to remember him
in<br>
 their future greatnesses, for he 'opined subtly' that he, even
he,<br>
 Mohendro Lal Dutt, MA of Calcutta, had 'done the State some<br>
 service'.</p>

<p>They gave him a certificate praising his courtesy,
helpfulness, and<br>
 unerring skill as a guide. He put it in his waist-belt and
sobbed<br>
 with emotion; they had endured so many dangers together. He led
them<br>
 at high noon along crowded Simla Mall to the Alliance Bank of
Simla,<br>
 where they wished to establish their identity. Thence he
vanished<br>
 like a dawn-cloud on Jakko.</p>

<p>Behold him, too fine-drawn to sweat, too pressed to vaunt the
drugs<br>
 in his little brass-bound box, ascending Shamlegh slope, a just
man<br>
 made perfect. Watch him, all Babudom laid aside, smoking at noon
on<br>
 a cot, while a woman with turquoise-studded headgear points
south-<br>
 easterly across the bare grass. Litters, she says, do not travel
as<br>
 fast as single men, but his birds should now be in the Plains.
The<br>
 holy man would not stay though Lispeth pressed him. The Babu
groans<br>
 heavily, girds up his huge loins, and is off again. He does not
care<br>
 to travel after dusk; but his days' marches - there is none to
enter<br>
 them in a book - would astonish folk who mock at his race.
Kindly<br>
 villagers, remembering the Dacca drug-vendor of two months ago,
give<br>
 him shelter against evil spirits of the wood. He dreams of
Bengali<br>
 Gods, University text-books of education, and the Royal
Society,<br>
 London, England. Next dawn the bobbing blue-and-white umbrella
goes<br>
 forward.</p>

<p>On the edge of the Doon, Mussoorie well behind them and the
Plains<br>
 spread out in golden dust before, rests a worn litter in which -
all<br>
 the Hills know it - lies a sick lama who seeks a River for
his<br>
 healing. Villages have almost come to blows over the honour
of<br>
 bearing it, for not only has the lama given them blessings, but
his<br>
 disciple good money - full one-third Sahibs' prices. Twelve
miles a<br>
 day has the dooli travelled, as the greasy, rubbed pole-ends
show,<br>
 and by roads that few Sahibs use. Over the Nilang Pass in storm
when<br>
 the driven snow-dust filled every fold of the impassive
lama's<br>
 drapery; between the black horns of Raieng where they heard
the<br>
 whistle of the wild goats through the clouds; pitching and
strained<br>
 on the shale below; hard-held between shoulder and clenched jaw
when<br>
 they rounded the hideous curves of the Cut Road under
Bhagirati;<br>
 swinging and creaking to the steady jog-trot of the descent into
the<br>
 Valley of the Waters; pressed along the steamy levels of that
locked<br>
 valley; up, up and out again, to meet the roaring gusts off<br>
 Kedarnath; set down of mid-days in the dun gloom of kindly
oak-<br>
 forests; passed from village to village in dawn-chill, when
even<br>
 devotees may be forgiven for swearing at impatient holy men;or
by<br>
 torchlight, when the least fearful think of ghosts - the dooli
has<br>
 reached her last stage. The little hill-folk sweat in the
modified<br>
 heat of the lower Siwaliks, and gather round the priests for
their<br>
 blessing and their wage.</p>

<p>'Ye have acquired merit,' says the lama. 'Merit greater than
your<br>
 knowing. And ye will return to the Hills,' he sighs.</p>

<p>'Surely. The high Hills as soon as may be.' The bearer rubs
his<br>
 shoulder, drinks water, spits it out again, and readjusts his
grass<br>
 sandal. Kim - his face is drawn and tired - pays very small
silver<br>
 from his belt', heaves out the food-bag, crams an oilskin packet
-<br>
 they are holy writings - into his bosom, and helps the lama to
his<br>
 feet. The peace has come again into the old man's eyes, and he
does<br>
 not look for the hills to fall down and crush him as he did
that<br>
 terrible night when they were delayed by the flooded river.</p>

<p>The men pick up the dooli and swing out of sight between the
scrub<br>
 clumps.</p>

<p>The lama raises a hand toward the rampart of the Himalayas.
'Not<br>
 with you, O blessed among all hills, fell the Arrow of Our Lord!
And<br>
 never shall I breathe your airs again!'</p>

<p>'But thou art ten times the stronger man in this good air,'
says<br>
 Kim, for to his wearied soul appeal the well-cropped, kindly
Plains.<br>
 'Here, or hereabouts, fell the Arrow, yes. We will go very
softly,<br>
 perhaps, a koss a day, for the Search is sure. But the bag
weighs<br>
 heavy.'</p>

<p>'Ay, our Search is sure. I have come out of great
temptation.'</p>

<p>It was never more than a couple of miles a day now, and
Kim's<br>
 shoulders bore all the weight of it - the burden of an old man,
the<br>
 burden of the heavy food-bag with the locked books, the load of
the<br>
 writings on his heart, and the details of the daily routine.
He<br>
 begged in the dawn, set blankets for the lama's meditation, held
the<br>
 weary head on his lap through the noonday heats, fanning away
the<br>
 flies till his wrists ached, begged again in the evenings,
and<br>
 rubbed the lama's feet, who rewarded him with promise of Freedom
-<br>
 today, tomorrow, or, at furthest, the next day.</p>

<p>'Never was such a chela. I doubt at times whether Ananda
more<br>
 faithfully nursed Our Lord. And thou art a Sahib? When I was a
man -<br>
 a long time ago - I forgot that. Now I look upon thee often,
and<br>
 every time I remember that thou art a Sahib. It is strange.'</p>

<p>'Thou hast said there is neither black nor white. Why plague
me with<br>
 this talk, Holy One? Let me rub the other foot. It vexes me. I
am<br>
 not a Sahib. I am thy chela, and my head is heavy on my
shoulders.'</p>

<p>'Patience a little! We reach Freedom together. Then thou and
I, upon<br>
 the far bank of the River, will look back upon our lives as in
the<br>
 Hills we saw our days' marches laid out behind us. Perhaps I was
once<br>
 a Sahib.'</p>

<p>"Was -never a Sahib like thee, I swear it.'</p>

<p>'I am certain the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House was
in<br>
 past life a very wise Abbot. But even his spectacles do not make
my<br>
 eyes see. There fall shadows when I would look steadily. No
matter -<br>
 we know the tricks of the poor stupid carcass - shadow changing
to<br>
 another shadow. I am bound by the illusion of Time and Space.
How<br>
 far came we today in the flesh?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps half a koss.' (Three quarters of a mile, and it was
a<br>
 weary march.)</p>

<p>'Half a koss. Ha! I went ten thousand thousand in the spirit.
How,<br>
 we are all lapped and swathed and swaddled in these
senseless<br>
 things.' He looked at his thin blue-veined hand that found the
beads<br>
 so heavy. 'Chela, hast thou never a wish to leave me?'</p>

<p>Kim thought of the oilskin packet and the books in the food-
bag. If<br>
 someone duly authorized would only take delivery of them the
Great<br>
 Game might play itself for aught he then cared. He was tired and
hot<br>
 in his head, and a cough that came from the stomach worried
him.</p>

<p>'No.' he said almost sternly. 'I am not a dog or a snake to
bite<br>
 when I have learned to love.'</p>

<p>'Thou art too tender towards me.'</p>

<p>'Not that either. I have moved in one matter without
consulting<br>
 thee. I have sent a message to the Kulu woman by that woman who
gave<br>
 us the goat's milk this morn, saying that thou wast a little
feeble<br>
 and wouldst need a litter. I beat myself in mv mind that I did
not<br>
 do it when we entered the Doon. e stay in this place till
the<br>
 litter returns.'</p>

<p>'I am content. She is a woman with a heart of gold, as thou
sayest,<br>
 but a talker - something of a talker.'</p>

<p>'She will not weary thee. I have looked to that also. Holy
One, my<br>
 heart is very heavy for my many carelessnesses towards thee.'
An<br>
 hysterical catch rose in his throat. 'I have walked thee too
far: I<br>
 have not picked good food always for thee; I have not considered
the<br>
 heat; I have talked to people on the road and left thee alone
... I<br>
 have - I have ... Hai mai! But I love thee ... and it is all
too<br>
 late ... I was a child . . . Oh, why was I not a man? . . .'<br>
 Overborne by strain, fatigue, and the weight beyond his years,
Kim<br>
 broke down and sobbed at the lama's feet.</p>

<p>'What a to-do is here!' said the old man gently. 'Thou hast
never<br>
 stepped a hair's breadth from the Way of Obedience. Neglect
me?<br>
 Child, I have lived on thy strength as an old tree lives on the
lime<br>
 of a new wall. Day by day, since Shamlegh down, I have
stolen<br>
 strength from thee. Therefore, not through any sin of thine,
art<br>
 thou weakened. It is the Body - the silly, stupid Body - that
speaks<br>
 now. Not the assured Soul. Be comforted! Know at least the
devils<br>
 that thou fightest. They are earth-born - children of illusion.
We<br>
 will go to the woman from Kulu. She shall acquire merit in
housing<br>
 us, and specially in tending me. Thou shalt run free till
strength<br>
 returns. I had forgotten the stupid Body. If there be any blame,
I<br>
 bear it. But we are too close to the Gates of Deliverance to
weigh<br>
 blame. I could praise thee, but what need? In a little - in a
very<br>
 little - we shall sit beyond all needs.'</p>

<p>And so he petted and comforted Kim with wise saws and grave
texts on<br>
 that little-understood beast, our Body, who, being but a
delusion,<br>
 insists on posing as the Soul, to the darkening of the Way, and
the<br>
 immense multiplication of unnecessary devils.</p>

<p>'Hai! hai! Let us talk of the woman from Kulu. Think you she
will<br>
 ask another charm for her grandsons? When I was a young man, a
very<br>
 long time ago, I was plagued with these vapours - and some
others -<br>
 and I went to an Abbot - a very holy man and a seeker after
truth,<br>
 though then I knew it not. Sit up and listen, child of my soul!
My<br>
 tale was told. Said he to me, "Chela, know this. There are many
lies<br>
 in the world, and not a few liars, but there are no liars like
our<br>
 bodies, except it be the sensations of our bodies." Considering
this<br>
 I was comforted, and of his great favour he suffered me to drink
tea<br>
 In his presence. Suffer me now to drink tea, for I am
thirsty.'</p>

<p>With a laugh across his tears, Kim kissed the lama's feet, and
set<br>
 about the tea-making.</p>

<p>'Thou leanest on me in the body, Holy One, but I lean on thee
for<br>
 some other things. Dost know it?'</p>

<p>'I have guessed maybe,' and the lama's eyes twinkled. 'We
must<br>
 change that.'</p>

<p>So, when with scufflings and scrapings and a hot air of
importance,<br>
 paddled up nothing less than the Sahiba's pet palanquin sent
twenty<br>
 miles, with that same grizzled old Oorya servant in charge, and
when<br>
 they reached the disorderly order of the long white rambling
house<br>
 behind Saharunpore, the lama took his own measures.</p>

<p>Said the Sahiba cheerily from an upper window, after
compliments:<br>
 'What is the good of an old woman's advice to an old man? I
told<br>
 thee - I told thee, Holy One, to keep an eye upon the chela.
How<br>
 didst thou do it? Never answer me! I know. He has been running
among<br>
 the women. Look at his eyes - hollow and sunk - and the
Betraying<br>
 Line from the nose down! He has been sifted out! Fie! Fie! And
a<br>
 priest, too!'</p>

<p>Kim looked up, over-weary to smile, shaking his head in
denial.</p>

<p>'Do not jest,' said the lama. 'That time is done. We are here
upon<br>
 great matters. A sickness of soul took me in the Hills, and him
a<br>
 sickness of the body. Since then I have lived upon his strength
-<br>
 eating him.'</p>

<p>'Children together - young and old,' she sniffed, but forbore
to<br>
 make any new jokes. 'May this present hospitality restore ye!
Hold<br>
 awhile and I will come to gossip of the high good Hills.'</p>

<p>At evening time - her son-in-law was returned, so she did not
need<br>
 to go on inspection round the farm - she won to the meat of
the<br>
 matter, explained low-voicedly by the lama. The two old heads
nodded<br>
 wisely together. Kim had reeled to a room with a cot in it, and
was<br>
 dozing soddenly. The lama had forbidden him to set blankets or
get<br>
 food.</p>

<p>'I know - I know. Who but I?' she cackled. 'We who go down to
the<br>
 burning-ghats clutch at the hands of those coming up from the
River<br>
 of Life with full water-jars - yes, brimming water-jars. I did
the<br>
 boy wrong. He lent thee his strength? It is true that the old
eat<br>
 the young daily. Stands now we must restore him.'</p>

<p>'Thou hast many times acquired merit -'</p>

<p>'My merit. What is it? Old bag of bones making curries for
men<br>
 who do not ask "Who cooked this?" Now if it were stored up for
my<br>
 grandson -'</p>

<p>'He that had the belly-pain?'</p>

<p>'To think the Holy One remembers that! I must tell his mother.
It is<br>
 most singular honour! "He that had the belly-pain" - straightway
the<br>
 Holy One remembered. She will be proud.'</p>

<p>'My chela is to me as is a son to the unenlightened.'</p>

<p>'Say grandson, rather. Mothers have not the wisdom of our
years. If<br>
 a child cries they say the heavens are falling. Now a
grandmother is<br>
 far enough separated from the pain of bearing and the pleasure
of<br>
 giving the breast to consider whether a cry is wickedness pure
or<br>
 the wind. And since thou speakest once again of wind, when last
the<br>
 Holy One was here, maybe I offended in pressing for charms.'</p>

<p>'Sister,' said the lama, using that form of address a Buddhist
monk<br>
 may sometimes employ towards a nun, 'if charms comfort thee
-'</p>

<p>'They are better than ten thousand doctors.'</p>

<p>'I say, if they comfort thee, I who was Abbot of Such-zen,
will make<br>
 as many as thou mayest desire. I have never seen thy face -'</p>

<p>'That even the monkeys who steal our loquats count for again.
Hee!<br>
 hee!'</p>

<p>'But as he who sleeps there said,' - he nodded at the shut
door of<br>
 the guest-chamber across the forecourt - 'thou hast a heart of
gold<br>
 ... And he is in the spirit my very "grandson" to me'</p>

<p>'Good! I am the Holy One's cow." This was pure Hinduism, but
the<br>
 lama never heeded. 'I am old. I have borne sons in the body.
Oh,<br>
 once I could please men! Now I can cure them.' He heard her
armlets<br>
 tinkle as though she bared arms for action. 'I will take over
the<br>
 boy and dose him, and stuff him, and make him all whole. Hat!
hai'!<br>
 We old people know something yet.'</p>

<p>Wherefore when Kim, aching in every bone, opened his eyes, and
would<br>
 go to the cook-house to get his master's food, he found
strong<br>
 coercion about him, and a veiled old figure at the door, flanked
by<br>
 the grizzled manservant, who told him very precisely the things
that<br>
 he was on no account to do.</p>

<p>'Thou must have? Thou shalt have nothing. What? A locked box
in<br>
 which to keep holy books? Oh, that is another matter.
Heavens<br>
 forbid I should come between a priest and his prayers! It shall
be<br>
 brought, and thou shalt keep the key.'</p>

<p>They pushed the coffer under his cot, and Kim shut away
Mahbub's<br>
 pistol, the oilskin packet of letters, and the locked books
and<br>
 diaries, with a groan of relief. For some absurd reason their
weight<br>
 on his shoulders was nothing to their weight on his poor mind.
His<br>
 neck ached under it of nights.</p>

<p>'Thine is a sickness uncommon in youth these days: since young
folk<br>
 have given up tending their betters. The remedy is sleep,
and<br>
 certain drugs,' said the Sahiba; and he was glad to give himself
up<br>
 to the blankness that half menaced and half soothed him.</p>

<p>She brewed drinks, in some mysterious Asiatic equivalent to
the<br>
 still-room - drenches that smelt pestilently and tasted worse.
She<br>
 stood over Kim till they went down, and inquired exhaustively
after<br>
 they had come up. She laid a taboo upon the forecourt, and
enforced<br>
 it by means of an armed man. It is true he was seventy odd, that
his<br>
 scabbarded sword ceased at the hilt; but he represented the<br>
 authority of the Sahiba, and loaded wains, chattering
servants,<br>
 calves, dogs, hens, and the like, fetched a wide compass by
those<br>
 parts. Best of all, when the body was cleared, she cut out from
the<br>
 mass of poor relations that crowded the back of the buildings
-<br>
 house-hold dogs, we name them - a cousin's widow, skilled in
what<br>
 Europeans, who know nothing about it, call massage. And the two
of<br>
 them, laying him east and west, that the mysterious
earth-currents<br>
 which thrill the clay of our bodies might help and not hinder,
took<br>
 him to pieces all one long afternoon - bone by bone, muscle
by<br>
 muscle, ligament by ligament, and lastly, nerve by nerve.
Kneaded to<br>
 irresponsible pulp, half hypnotized by the perpetual flick
and<br>
 readjustment of the uneasy chudders that veiled their eyes, Kim
slid<br>
 ten thousand miles into slumber - thirty-six hours of it -
sleep<br>
 that soaked like rain after drought.</p>

<br>
Then she fed him, and the house spun to her clamour. She caused
<br>
fowls to be slain; she sent for vegetables, and the sober,
slow-<br>
thinking gardener, nigh as old as she, sweated for it; she took
<br>
spices, and milk, and onion, with little fish from the brooks -
anon <br>
limes for sherbets, fat quails from the pits, then chicken-livers
<br>
upon a skewer, with sliced ginger between.

<p>'I have seen something of this world,' she said over the
crowded<br>
 trays, 'and there are but two sorts of women in it -those who
take<br>
 the strength out of a man and those who put it back. Once I was
that<br>
 one, and now I am this. Nay - do not play the priestling with
me.<br>
 Mine was but a jest. If it does not hold good now, it will when
thou<br>
 takest the road again. Cousin,' - this to the poor relation,
never<br>
 wearied of extolling her patroness's charity -'he is getting a
bloom<br>
 on the skin of a new-curried horse. Our work is like
polishing<br>
 jewels to be thrown to a dance-girl - eh?'</p>

<p>Kim sat up and smiled. The terrible weakness had dropped from
him<br>
 like an old shoe. His tongue itched for free speech again, and
but a<br>
 week back the lightest word clogged it like ashes. The pain in
his<br>
 neck (he must have caught it from the lama) had gone with the
heavy<br>
 dengue-aches and the evil taste in the mouth. The two old women,
a<br>
 little, but not much, more careful about their veils now,
clucked as<br>
 merrily as the hens that had entered pecking through the open
door.</p>

<p>'Where is my Holy One?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'Hear him! Thy Holy One is well,' she snapped viciously.
'Though<br>
 that is none of his merit., Knew I a charm to make him wise,
I'd<br>
 sell my jewels and buy it. To refuse good food that I cooked
myself<br>
 - and go roving into the fields for two nights on an empty belly
-<br>
 and to tumble into a brook at the end of it - call you that<br>
 holiness? Then, when he has nearly broken what thou hast left of
my<br>
 heart with anxiety, he tells me that he has acquired merit. Oh,
how<br>
 like are all men! No, that was not it - he tells me that he is
freed<br>
 from all sin. I could have told him that before he wetted
himself<br>
 all over. He is well now - this happened a week ago - but burn
me<br>
 such holiness! A babe of three would do better. Do not fret
thyself<br>
 for the Holy One. He keeps both eyes on thee when he is not
wading<br>
 our brooks.'</p>

<p>'I do not remember to have seen him. I remember that the days
and<br>
 nights passed like bars of white and black, opening and
shutting. I<br>
 was not sick: I was but tired."</p>

<p>'A lethargy that comes by right some few score years later.
But it is<br>
 done now.'</p>

<p>'Maharanee,' Kim began, but led by the look in her eye,
changed it<br>
 to the title of plain love - 'Mother, I owe my life to thee.
How<br>
 shall I make thanks? Ten thousand blessings upon thy house and
-'</p>

<p>'The house be unblessed!' (It is impossible to give exactly
the old<br>
 lady's word.) 'Thank the Gods as a priest if thou wilt, but
thank<br>
 me, if thou carest, as a son. Heavens above! Have I shifted thee
and<br>
 lifted thee and slapped and twisted thy ten toes to find texts
flung<br>
 at my head? Somewhere a mother must have borne thee to break
her<br>
 heart. What used thou to her - son?'</p>

<p>'I had no mother, my mother,' said Kim. 'She died, they tell
me,<br>
 when I was young.'</p>

<p>'Hai mai! Then none can say I have robbed her of any right if
- when<br>
 thou takest the road again and this house is but one of a
thousand<br>
 used for shelter and forgotten, after an easy-flung blessing.
No<br>
 matter. I need no blessings, but - but -' She stamped her foot
at<br>
 the poor relation. 'Take up the trays to the house. What is the
good<br>
 of stale food in the room, O woman of ill-omen?'</p>

<p>'I ha - have borne a son in my time too, but he died,'
whimpered the<br>
 bowed sister-figure behind the chudder. 'Thou knowest he died!
I<br>
 only waited for the order to take away the, tray.'</p>

<p>'It is I that am the woman of ill-omen,' cried the old
lady<br>
 penitently. 'We that go down to the chattris [the big
umbrellas<br>
 above the burning-ghats where the priests take their last
dues]<br>
 clutch hard at the bearers of the chattis [water-jars - young
folk<br>
 full of the pride of life, she meant; but the pun is
clumsy].When<br>
 one cannot dance in the festival one must e'en look out of
the<br>
 window, and grandmothering takes all a woman's time. Thy
master<br>
 gives me all the charms I now desire for my daughter's eldest,
by<br>
 reason - is it? - that he is wholly free from sin. The hakim
is<br>
 brought very low these days. He goes about poisoning my servants
for<br>
 lack of their betters.'</p>

<p>'What hakim, mother?'</p>

<p>'That very Dacca man who gave me the pill which rent me in
three<br>
 pieces. He cast up like a strayed camel a week ago, vowing that
he<br>
 and thou had been blood-brothers together up Kulu-way, and
feigning<br>
 great anxiety for thy health. He was very thin and hungry, so I
gave<br>
 orders to have him stuffed too - him and his anxiety!'</p>

<p>'I would see him if he is here.'</p>

<p>'He eats five times a day, and lances boils for my hinds to
save<br>
 himself from an apoplexy. He is so full of anxiety for thy
health<br>
 that he sticks to the cook-house door and stays himself with
scraps.<br>
 He will keep. We shall never get rid of him.'</p>

<p>'Send him here, mother' - the twinkle returned to Kim's eye
for a<br>
 flash - 'and I will try.'</p>

<p>'I'll send him, but to chase him off is an ill turn. At least
he had<br>
 the sense to fish the Holy One out of the brook; thus, as the
Holy<br>
 One did not say, acquiring merit.'</p>

<p>'He is a very wise hakim. Send him, mother.'</p>

<p>'Priest praising priest? A miracle! If he is any friend of
thine (ye<br>
 squabbled at your last meeting) I'll hale him here with
horse-ropes<br>
 and - and give him a caste-dinner afterwards, my son ... Get up
and<br>
 see the world! This lying abed is the mother of seventy devils
...<br>
 my son! my son!'</p>

<p>She trotted forth to raise a typhoon off the cook-house, and
almost<br>
 on her shadow rolled in the Babu, robed as to the shoulders like
a<br>
 Roman emperor, jowled like Titus, bare-headed, with new
patent-<br>
 leather shoes, in highest condition of fat, exuding joy and<br>
 salutations.</p>

<p>'By Jove, Mister O'Hara, but I are jolly-glad to see you. I
will<br>
 kindly shut the door. It is a pity you are sick. Are you very
sick?'</p>

<p>'The papers - the papers from the kilta. The maps and the
murasla!'<br>
 He held out the key impatiently; for the present need on his
soul<br>
 was to get rid of the loot.</p>

<p>'You are quite right. That is correct Departmental view to
take. You<br>
 have got everything?'</p>

<p>'All that was handwritten in the kilta I took. The rest I
threw down<br>
 the hill.' He could hear the key's grate in the lock, the
sticky<br>
 pull of the slow-rending oilskin, and a quick shuffling of
papers.<br>
 He had been annoyed out of all reason by the knowledge that they
lay<br>
 below him through the sick idle days - a burden incommunicable.
For<br>
 that reason the blood tingled through his body, when Hurree,<br>
 skipping elephantinely, shook hands again.</p>

<p>'This is fine! This is finest! Mister O'Hara! you have - ha!
ha!<br>
 swiped the whole bag of tricks - locks, stocks, and barrels.
They<br>
 told me it was eight months' work gone up the spouts! By Jove,
how<br>
 they beat me! ... Look, here is the letter from Hilas!' He
intoned a<br>
 line or two of Court Persian, which is the language of
authorized<br>
 and unauthorized diplomacy. 'Mister Rajah Sahib has just about
put<br>
 his foot in the holes. He will have to explain offeecially how
the<br>
 deuce-an'-all he is writing love-letters to the Czar. And they
are<br>
 very clever maps ... and there is three or four Prime Ministers
of<br>
 these parts implicated by the correspondence. By Gad, sar!
The<br>
 British Government will change the succession in Hilas and
Bunar,<br>
 and nominate new heirs to the throne. "Trea-son most base" ...
but<br>
 you do not understand? Eh?'</p>

<p>'Are they in thy hands?' said Kim. It was all he cared
for.</p>

<p>'Just you jolly-well bet yourself they are.' He stowed the
entire<br>
 trove about his body, as only Orientals can. 'They are going up
to<br>
 the office, too. The old lady thinks I am permanent fixture
here,<br>
 but I shall go away with these straight off - immediately. Mr
Lurgan<br>
 will be proud man. You are offeecially subordinate to me, but
I<br>
 shall embody your name in my verbal report. It is a pity we are
not<br>
 allowed written reports. We Bengalis excel in thee exact
science.'<br>
 He tossed back the key and showed the box empty.</p>

<p>'Good. That is good. I was very tired. My Holy One was sick,
too.<br>
 And did he fall into -'</p>

<p>'Oah yess. I am his good friend, I tell you. He was behaving
very<br>
 strange when I came down after you, and I thought perhaps he
might<br>
 have the papers. I followed him on his meditations, and to
discuss<br>
 ethnological points also. You see, I am verree small person
here<br>
 nowadays, in comparison with all his charms. By Jove, O'Hara, do
you<br>
 know, he is afflicted with infirmity of fits. Yess, I tell
you.<br>
 Cataleptic, too, if not also epileptic. I found him in such a
state<br>
 under a tree in articulo mortem, and he jumped up and walked
into a<br>
 brook and he was nearly drowned but for me. I pulled him
out.'</p>

<p>'Because I was not there!' said Kim. 'He might have died.'</p>

<p>'Yes, he might have died, but he is dry now, and asserts he
has<br>
 undergone transfiguration.' The Babu tapped his forehead
knowingly.<br>
 'I took notes of his statements for Royal Society - in posse.
You<br>
 must make haste and be quite well and come back to Simla, and I
will<br>
 tell you all my tale at Lurgan's. It was splendid. The bottoms
of<br>
 their trousers were quite torn, and old Nahan Rajah, he thought
they<br>
 were European soldiers deserting.'</p>

<p>'Oh, the Russians? How long were they with thee?'</p>

<p>'One was a Frenchman. Oh, days and days and days! Now all the
hill-<br>
 people believe all Russians are all beggars. By Jove! they had
not<br>
 one dam'-thing that I did not get them. And I told the common
people<br>
 - oah, such tales and anecdotes! -I will tell you at old
Lurgan's<br>
 when you come up. We will have - ah - a night out! It is feather
in<br>
 both our caps! Yess, and they gave me a certificate. That is<br>
 creaming joke. You should have seen them at the Alliance
Bank<br>
 identifying themselves! And thank Almighty God you got their
papers<br>
 so well! You do not laugh verree much, but you shall laugh when
you<br>
 are well. Now I will go straight to the railway and get out.
You<br>
 shall have all sorts of credits for your game. When do you
come<br>
 along? We are very proud of you though you gave us great
frights.<br>
 And especially Mahbub.'</p>

<p>'Ay, Mahbub. And where is he?'</p>

<p>'Selling horses in this vi-cinity, of course.'</p>

<p>'Here! Why? Speak slowly. There is a thickness in my head
still.'</p>

<p>The Babu looked shyly down his nose. 'Well, you see, I am
fearful<br>
 man, and I do not like responsibility. You were sick, you see,
and I<br>
 did not know where deuce-an'-all the papers were, and if so,
how<br>
 many. So when I had come down here I slipped in private wire
to<br>
 Mahbub - he was at Meerut for races - and I tell him how
case<br>
 stands. He comes up with his men and he consorts with the lama,
and<br>
 then he calls me a fool, and is very rude -'</p>

<p>'But wherefore - wherefore?'</p>

<p>'That is what I ask. I only suggest that if anyone steals the
papers<br>
 I should like some good strong, brave men to rob them back
again.<br>
 You see, they are vitally important, and Mahbub Ali he did not
know<br>
 where you were.'</p>

<p>'Mahbub Ali to rob the Sahiba's house? Thou art mad, Babu,'
said<br>
 Kim with indignation.</p>

<p>'I wanted the papers. Suppose she had stole them? It was
only<br>
 practical suggestion, I think. You are not pleased, eh?'</p>

<p>A native proverb - unquotable - showed the blackness of
Kim's<br>
 disapproval.</p>

<p>'Well,' - Hurree shrugged his shoulders - 'there is no
accounting<br>
 for thee taste. Mahbub was angry too. He has sold horses all
about<br>
 here, and he says old lady is pukka [thorough] old lady and
would<br>
 not condescend to such ungentlemanly things. I do not care. I
have<br>
 got the papers, and I was very glad of moral support from
Mahbub. I<br>
 tell you, I am fearful man, but, somehow or other, the more
fearful<br>
 I am the more dam'-tight places I get into. So I was glad you
came<br>
 with me to Chini, and I am glad Mahbub was close by. The old
lady<br>
 she is sometimes very rude to me and my beautiful pills.'</p>

<p>'Allah be merciful!' said Kim on his elbow, rejoicing. 'What a
beast<br>
 of wonder is a Babu! And that man walked alone - if he did walk
-<br>
 with robbed and angry foreigners!'</p>

<p>'Oah, thatt was nothing, after they had done beating me; but
if I<br>
 lost the papers it was pretty-jolly serious. Mahbub he nearly
beat<br>
 me too, and he went and consorted with the lama no end. I
shall<br>
 stick to ethnological investigations henceforwards. Now
good-bye,<br>
 Mister O'Hara. I can catch 4.25 p.m. to Umballa if I am quick.
It<br>
 will be good times when we all tell thee tale up at Mr Lurgan's.
I<br>
 shall report you offeecially better. Good-bye, my dear fallow,
and<br>
 when next you are under thee emotions please do not use the<br>
 Mohammedan terms with the Tibetan dress.'</p>

<p>He shook hands twice - a Babu to his boot-heels - and opened
the<br>
 door. With the fall of the sunlight upon his still triumphant
face<br>
 he returned to the humble Dacca quack.</p>

<p>'He robbed them,' thought Kim, forgetting his own share in the
game.<br>
 'He tricked them. He lied to them like a Bengali. They give him
a<br>
 chit [a testimonial]. He makes them a mock at the risk of his
life -<br>
 I never would have gone down to them after the pistol-shots -
and<br>
 then he says he is a fearful man ... And he is a fearful man. I
must<br>
 get into the world again.'</p>

<p>At first his legs bent like bad pipe-stems, and the flood and
rush<br>
 of the sunlit air dazzled him. He squatted by the white wall,
the<br>
 mind rummaging among the incidents of the long dooli journey,
the<br>
 lama's weaknesses, and, now that the stimulus of talk was
removed,<br>
 his own self-pity, of which, like the sick, he had great store.
The<br>
 unnerved brain edged away from all the outside, as a raw horse,
once<br>
 rowelled, sidles from the spur. It was enough, amply enough,
that<br>
 the spoil of the kilta was away - off his hands - out of his<br>
 possession. He tried to think of the lama - to wonder why he
had<br>
 tumbled into a brook - but the bigness of the world, seen
between<br>
 the forecourt gates, swept linked thought aside. Then he looked
upon<br>
 the trees and the broad fields, with the thatched huts hidden
among<br>
 crops - looked with strange eyes unable to take up the size
and<br>
 proportion and use of things - stared for a still half-hour.
All<br>
 that while he felt, though he could not put it into words, that
his<br>
 soul was out of gear with its surroundings - a cog-wheel<br>
 unconnected with any machinery, just like the idle cog-wheel of
a<br>
 cheap Beheea sugar-crusher laid by in a corner. The breezes
fanned<br>
 over him, the parrots shrieked at him, the noises of the
populated<br>
 house behind - squabbles, orders, and reproofs - hit on dead
ears.</p>

<p>'I am Kim. I am Kim. And what is Kim?' His soul repeated it
again<br>
 and again.</p>

<p>He did not want to cry - had never felt less like crying in
his life<br>
 - but of a sudden easy, stupid tears trickled down his nose,
and<br>
 with an almost audible click he felt the wheels of his being
lock up<br>
 anew on the world without. Things that rode meaningless on
the<br>
 eyeball an instant before slid into proper proportion. Roads
were<br>
 meant to be walked upon, houses to belived in, cattle to be
driven,<br>
 fields to be tilled, and men and women to be talked to. They
were<br>
 all real and true - solidly planted upon the feet -
perfectly<br>
 comprehensible - clay of his clay, neither more nor less. He
shook<br>
 himself like a dog with a flea in his ear, and rambled out of
the<br>
 gate. Said the Sahiba, to whom watchful eyes reported this
move:<br>
 'Let him go. I have done my share. Mother Earth must do the
rest.<br>
 When the Holy One comes back from meditation, tell him.'</p>

<p>There stood an empty bullock-cart on a little knoll half a
mile<br>
 away, with a young banyan tree behind - a look-out, as it
were,<br>
 above some new-ploughed levels; and his eyelids, bathed in soft
air,<br>
 grew heavy as he neared it. The ground was good clean dust - no
new<br>
 herbage that, living, is half-way to death already, but the
hopeful<br>
 dust that holds the seeds of all life. He felt it between his
toes,<br>
 patted it with his palms, and joint by joint, sighing
luxuriously,<br>
 laid him down full length along in the shadow of the
wooden-pinned<br>
 cart. And Mother Earth was as faithful as the Sahiba. She
breathed<br>
 through him to restore the poise he had lost lying so long on a
cot<br>
 cut off from her good currents. His head lay powerless upon
her<br>
 breast, and his opened hands surrendered to her strength. The
many-<br>
 rooted tree above him, and even the dead manhandled wood
beside,<br>
 knew what he sought, as he himself did not know. Hour upon hour
he<br>
 lay deeper than sleep.</p>

<p>Towards evening, when the dust of returning kine made all
the<br>
 horizons smoke, came the lama and Mahbub Ali, both afoot,
walking<br>
 cautiously, for the house had told them where he had gone.</p>

<br>
'Allah! What a fool's trick to play in open country!' muttered
the <br>
horse-dealer. 'He could be shot a hundred times - but this is not
<br>
the Border.'

<p>'And,' said the lama, repeating a many-times-told tale, 'never
was<br>
 such a chela. Temperate, kindly, wise, of ungrudging
disposition, a<br>
 merry heart upon the road, never forgetting, learned,
truthful,<br>
 courteous. Great is his reward!'</p>

<p>'I know the boy - as I have said.'</p>

<p>'And he was all those things?'</p>

<p>'Some of them - but I have not yet found a Red Hat's charm
for<br>
 making him overly truthful. He has certainly been well
nursed.'</p>

<p>'The Sahiba is a heart of gold,' said the lama earnestly. 'She
looks<br>
 upon him as her son.'</p>

<p>'Hmph! Half Hind seems that way disposed. I only wished to see
that<br>
 the boy had come to no harm and was a free agent. As thou
knowest,<br>
 he and I were old friends in the first days of your
pilgrimage<br>
 together.'</p>

<p>'That is a bond between us.' The lama sat down. 'We are at the
end<br>
 of the pilgrimage.'</p>

<p>'No thanks to thee thine was not cut off for good and all a
week<br>
 back. I heard what the Sahiba said to thee when we bore thee up
on<br>
 the cot.' Mahbub laughed, and tugged his newly dyed beard.</p>

<p>'I was meditating upon other matters that tide. It was the
hakim<br>
 from Dacca broke my meditations.'</p>

<p>'Otherwise' - this was in Pushtu for decency's sake -'thou
wouldst<br>
 have ended thy meditations upon the sultry side of Hell - being
an<br>
 unbeliever and an idolater for all thy child's simplicity. But
now,<br>
 Red Hat, what is to be done?'</p>

<p>'This very night,' - the words came slowly, vibrating with
triumph -<br>
 'this very night he will be as free as I am from all taint of
sin -<br>
 assured as I am, when he quits this body, of Freedom from the
Wheel<br>
 of Things. I have a sign' - he laid his hand above the torn
chart in<br>
 his bosom -'that my time is short; but I shall have safeguarded
him<br>
 throughout the years. Remember, I have reached Knowledge, as I
told<br>
 thee only three nights back.'</p>

<p>'It must be true, as the Tirah priest said when I stole his
cousin's<br>
 wife, that I am a Sufi [a free-thinker]; for here I sit, I
said<br>
 Mahbub to himself, 'drinking in blasphemy unthinkable ... I
remember<br>
 the tale. On that, then, he goes to Fannatu l'Adn [the Gardens
of<br>
 Eden]. But how? Wilt thou slay him or drown him in that
wonderful<br>
 river from which the Babu dragged thee?'</p>

<p>'I was dragged from no river,' said the lama simply. 'Thou
hast<br>
 forgotten what befell. I found it by Knowledge.'</p>

<p>'Oh, ay. True,' stammered Mahbub, divided between high
indignation<br>
 and enormous mirth. 'I had forgotten the exact run of what
happened.<br>
 Thou didst find it knowingly.'</p>

<p>'And to say that I would take life is - not a sin, but a
madness<br>
 simple. My chela aided me to the River. It is his right to
be<br>
 cleansed from sin - with me.'</p>

<p>'Ay, he needs cleansing. But afterwards, old man -
afterwards?'</p>

<p>'What matter under all the Heavens? He is sure of Nibban -<br>
 enlightened - as I am.'</p>

<p>'Well said. I had a fear he might mount Mohammed's Horse and
fly<br>
 away.'</p>

<p>'Nay - he must go forth as a teacher.'</p>

<p>'Aha! Now I see! That is the right gait for the colt.
Certainly he<br>
 must go forth as a teacher. He is somewhat urgently needed as
a<br>
 scribe by the State, for instance.'</p>

<p>'To that end he was prepared. I acquired merit in that I gave
alms<br>
 for his sake. A good deed does not die. He aided me in my
Search. I<br>
 aided him in his. Just is the Wheel, O horse-seller from the
North.<br>
 Let him be a teacher; let him be a scribe - what matter? He
will<br>
 have attained Freedom at the end. The rest is illusion.'</p>

<p>'What matter? When I must have him with me beyond Balkh in
six<br>
 months! I come up with ten lame horses and three strong-backed
men -<br>
 thanks to that chicken of a Babu - to break a sick boy by force
out<br>
 of an old trot's house. It seems that I stand by while a young
Sahib<br>
 is hoisted into Allah knows what of an idolater's Heaven by
means of<br>
 old Red Hat. And I am reckoned something of a player of the
Game<br>
 myself! But the madman is fond of the boy; and I must be
very<br>
 reasonably mad too.'</p>

<p>'What is the prayer?' said the lama, as the rough Pushtu
rumbled<br>
 into the red beard.</p>

<p>'No matter at all; but now I understand that the boy, sure
of<br>
 Paradise, can yet enter Government service, my mind is easier.
I<br>
 must get to my horses. It grows dark. Do not wake him. I have
no<br>
 wish to hear him call thee master.'</p>

<p>'But he is my disciple. What else?'</p>

<p>'He has told me.' Mahbub choked down his touch of spleen and
rose<br>
 laughing. 'I am not altogether of thy faith, Red Hat - if so
small a<br>
 matter concern thee.'</p>

<p>'It is nothing, said the lama.</p>

<p>'I thought not. Therefore it will not move thee, sinless,
new-<br>
 washed and three parts drowned to boot, when I call thee a good
man<br>
 - a very good man. We have talked together some four or five<br>
 evenings now, and for all I am a horse-coper I can still, as
the<br>
 saying is, see holiness beyond the legs of a horse. Yea, can
see,<br>
 too, how our Friend of all the World put his hand in thine at
the<br>
 first. Use him well, and suffer him to return to the world as
a<br>
 teacher, when thou hast - bathed his legs, if that be the
proper<br>
 medicine for the colt.'</p>

<p>'Why not follow the Way thyself, and so accompany the
boy?'</p>

<p>Mahbub stared stupefied at the magnificent insolence of the
demand,<br>
 which across the Border he would have paid with more than a
blow.<br>
 Then the humour of it touched his worldly soul.</p>

<p>'Softly - softly - one foot at a time, as the lame gelding
went over<br>
 the Umballa jumps. I may come to Paradise later - I have
workings<br>
 that way - great motions - and I owe them to thy simplicity.
Thou<br>
 hast never lied?'</p>

<p>'What need?'</p>

<p>'O Allah, hear him! "What need" in this Thy world! Nor ever
harmed a<br>
 man?'</p>

<p>'Once - with a pencase - before I was wise.'</p>

<p>'So? I think the better of thee. Thy teachings are good. Thou
hast<br>
 turned one man that I know from the path of strife.' He
laughed<br>
 immensely. 'He came here open-minded to commit a dacoity [a
house-<br>
 robbery with violence]. Yes, to cut, rob, kill, and carry off
what<br>
 he desired.'</p>

<p>'A great foolishness!'</p>

<p>'Oh! black shame too. So he thought after he had seen thee -
and a<br>
 few others, male and female. So he abandoned it; and now he goes
to<br>
 beat a big fat Babu man.'</p>

<p>'I do not understand.'</p>

<p>'Allah forbid it! Some men are strong in knowledge, Red Hat.
Thy<br>
 strength is stronger still. Keep it - I think thou wilt. If the
boy<br>
 be not a good servant, pull his ears off.'</p>

<p>With a hitch of his broad Bokhariot belt the Pathan swaggered
off<br>
 into the gloaming, and the lama came down from his clouds so far
as<br>
 to look at the broad back.</p>

<p>'That person lacks courtesy, and is deceived by the shadow
of<br>
 appearances. But he spoke well of my chela, who now enters upon
his<br>
 reward. Let me make the prayer! ... Wake, O fortunate above all
born<br>
 of women. Wake! It is found!'</p>

<p>Kim came up from those deep wells, and the lama attended his
yawning<br>
 pleasure; duly snapping fingers to head off evil spirits.</p>

<p>'I have slept a hundred years. Where -? Holy One, hast thou
been<br>
 here long? I went out to look for thee, but' - he laughed
drowsily -<br>
 'I slept by the way. I am all well now. Hast thou eaten? Let us
go<br>
 to the house. It is many days since I tended thee. And the
Sahiba<br>
 fed thee well? Who shampooed thy legs? What of the weaknesses -
the<br>
 belly and the neck, and the beating in the ears?'</p>

<p>'Gone - all gone. Dost thou not know?'</p>

<p>'I know nothing, but that I have not seen thee in a monkey's
age.<br>
 Know what?'</p>

<p>'Strange the knowledge did not reach out to thee, when all
my<br>
 thoughts were theeward.'</p>

<p>'I cannot see the face, but the voice is like a gong. Has the
Sahiba<br>
 made a young man of thee by her cookery?'</p>

<p>He peered at the cross-legged figure, outlined jet-black
against the<br>
 lemon-coloured drift of light. So does the stone Bodhisat sit
who<br>
 looks down upon the patent self-registering turnstiles of the
Lahore<br>
 Museum.</p>

<p>The lama held his peace. Except for the click of the rosary
and a<br>
 faint clop-clop of Mahbub's retreating feet, the soft, smoky
silence<br>
 of evening in India wrapped them close.</p>

<p>'Hear me! I bring news.'</p>

<p>'But let us -'</p>

<p>Out shot the long yellow hand compelling silence. Kim tucked
his<br>
 feet under his robe-edge obediently.</p>

<p>'Hear me! I bring news! The Search is finished. Comes now the
Reward<br>
 ... Thus. When we were among the Hills, I lived on thy strength
till<br>
 the young branch bowed and nigh broke. When we came out of
the<br>
 Hills, I was troubled for thee and for other matters which I
held in<br>
 my heart. The boat of my soul lacked direction; I could not see
into<br>
 the Cause of Things. So I gave thee over to the virtuous
woman<br>
 altogether. I took no food. I drank no water. Still I saw not
the<br>
 Way. They pressed food upon me and cried at my shut door. So
I<br>
 removed myself to a hollow under a tree. I took no food. I took
no<br>
 water. I sat in meditation two days and two nights, abstracting
my<br>
 mind; inbreathing and outbreathing in the required manner . . .
Upon<br>
 the second night - so great was my reward - the wise Soul
loosed<br>
 itself from the silly Body and went free. This I have never
before<br>
 attained, though I have stood on the threshold of it. Consider,
for<br>
 it is a marvel!'</p>

<p>'A marvel indeed. Two days and two nights without food! Where
was<br>
 the Sahiba?' said Kim under his breath.</p>

<p>'Yea, my Soul went free, and, wheeling like an eagle, saw
indeed<br>
 that there was no Teshoo Lama nor any other soul. As a drop
draws to<br>
 water, so my Soul drew near to the Great Soul which is beyond
all<br>
 things. At that point, exalted in contemplation, I saw all
Hind,<br>
 from Ceylon in the sea to the Hills, and my own Painted Rocks
at<br>
 Such-zen; I saw every camp and village, to the least, where we
have<br>
 ever rested. I saw them at one time and in one place; for they
were<br>
 within the Soul. By this I knew the Soul had passed beyond
the<br>
 illusion of Time and Space and of Things. By this I knew that I
was<br>
 free. I saw thee lying in thy cot, and I saw thee falling
downhill<br>
 under the idolater - at one time, in one place, in my Soul,
which,<br>
 as I say, had touched the Great Soul. Also I saw the stupid body
of<br>
 Teshoo Lama lying down, and the hakim from Dacca kneeled
beside,<br>
 shouting in its ear. Then my Soul was all alone, and I saw
nothing,<br>
 for I was all things, having reached the Great Soul. And I
meditated<br>
 a thousand thousand years, passionless, well aware of the Causes
of<br>
 all Things. Then a voice cried: "What shall come to the boy if
thou<br>
 art dead?" and I was shaken back and forth in myself with pity
for<br>
 thee; and I said: "I will return to my chela, lest he miss the
Way."<br>
 Upon this my Soul, which is the Soul of Teshoo Lama, withdrew
itself<br>
 from the Great Soul with strivings and yearnings and retchings
and<br>
 agonies not to be told. As the egg from the fish, as the fish
from<br>
 the water, as the water from the cloud, as the cloud from the
thick<br>
 air, so put forth, so leaped out, so drew away, so fumed up the
Soul<br>
 of Teshoo Lama from the Great Soul. Then a voice cried: "The
River!<br>
 Take heed to the River!" and I looked down upon all the world,
which<br>
 was as I had seen it before - one in time, one in place - and I
saw<br>
 plainly the River of the Arrow at my feet. At that hour my Soul
was<br>
 hampered by some evil or other whereof I was not wholly
cleansed,<br>
 and it lay upon my arms and coiled round my waist; but I put
it<br>
 aside, and I cast forth as an eagle in my flight for the very
place<br>
 of the River. I pushed aside world upon world for thy sake. I
saw<br>
 the River below me - the River of the Arrow - and, descending,
the<br>
 waters of it closed over me; and behold I was again in the body
of<br>
 Teshoo Lama, but free from sin, and the hakim from Decca bore up
my<br>
 head in the waters of the River. It is here! It is behind the
mango-<br>
 tope here - even here!'</p>

<p>'Allah kerim! Oh, well that the Babu was by! Wast thou very
wet?'</p>

<p>'Why should I regard? I remember the hakim was concerned for
the<br>
 body of Teshoo Lama. He haled it out of the holy water in his
hands,<br>
 and there came afterwards thy horse-seller from the North with a
cot<br>
 and men, and they put the body on the cot and bore it up to
the<br>
 Sahiba's house.'</p>

<br>
'What said the Sahiba?'

<p>'I was meditating in that body, and did not hear. So thus the
Search<br>
 is ended. For the merit that I have acquired, the River of the
Arrow<br>
 is here. It broke forth at our feet, as I have said. I have
found<br>
 it. Son of my Soul, I have wrenched my Soul back from the
Threshold<br>
 of Freedom to free thee from all sin - as I am free, and
sinless!<br>
 Just is the Wheel! Certain is our deliverance! Come!'</p>

<p>He crossed his hands on his lap and smiled, as a man may who
has won<br>
 salvation for himself and his beloved.</p>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
