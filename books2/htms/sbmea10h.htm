<h2>My Own True Ghost Story</h2>

<p><br>
 As I came through the Desert thus it was--<br>
 As I came through the Desert.<br>
 The City of Dreadful Night.</p>

<p><br>
 Somewhere in the Other World, where there are books and
pictures<br>
 and plays and shop windows to look at, and thousands of men
who<br>
 spend their lives in building up all four, lives a gentleman
who<br>
 writes real stories about the real insides of people; and his
name<br>
 is Mr. Walter Besant. But he will insist upon treating his
ghosts--<br>
 he has published half a workshopful of them--with levity. He<br>
 makes his ghost-seers talk familiarly, and, in some cases,
flirt<br>
 outrageously, with the phantoms. You may treat anything, from
a<br>
 Viceroy to a Vernacular Paper, with levity; but you must
behave<br>
 reverently toward a ghost, and particularly an Indian one.</p>

<p><br>
 There are, in this land, ghosts who take the form of fat,
cold,<br>
 pobby corpses, and hide in trees near the roadside till a
traveler<br>
 passes. Then they drop upon his neck and remain. There are
also<br>
 terrible ghosts of women who have died in child-bed. These
wander<br>
 along the pathways at dusk, or hide in the crops near a
village,<br>
 and call seductively. But to answer their call is death in
this<br>
 world and the next. Their feet are turned backward that all
sober<br>
 men may recognize them. There are ghosts of little children
who<br>
 have been thrown into wells. These haunt well curbs and the<br>
 fringes of jungles, and wail under the stars, or catch women by
the<br>
 wrist and beg to be taken up and carried. These and the
corpse<br>
 ghosts, however, are only vernacular articles and do not
attack<br>
 Sahibs. No native ghost has yet been authentically reported
to<br>
 have frightened an Englishman; but many English ghosts have
scared<br>
 the life out of both white and black.</p>

<p>Nearly every other Station owns a ghost. There are said to be
two<br>
 at Simla, not counting the woman who blows the bellows at
Syree<br>
 dak-bungalow on the Old Road; Mussoorie has a house haunted of
a<br>
 very lively Thing; a White Lady is supposed to do
night-watchman<br>
 round a house in Lahore; Dalhousie says that one of her
houses<br>
 "repeats" on autumn evenings all the incidents of a horrible
horse-<br>
 and-precipice accident; Murree has a merry ghost, and, now that
she<br>
 has been swept by cholera, will have room for a sorrowful
one;<br>
 there are Officers' Quarters in Mian Mir whose doors open
without<br>
 reason, and whose furniture is guaranteed to creak, not with
the<br>
 heat of June but with the weight of Invisibles who come to
lounge<br>
 in the chairs; Peshawur possesses houses that none will
willingly<br>
 rent; and there is something--not fever--wrong with a big
bungalow<br>
 in Allahabad. The older Provinces simply bristle with
haunted<br>
 houses, and march phantom armies along their main
thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Some of the dak-bungalows on the Grand Trunk Road have handy
little<br>
 cemeteries in their compound--witnesses to the "changes and
chances<br>
 of this mortal life" in the days when men drove from Calcutta
to<br>
 the Northwest. These bungalows are objectionable places to put
up<br>
 in. They are generally very old, always dirty, while the
khansamah<br>
 is as ancient as the bungalow. He either chatters senilely,
or<br>
 falls into the long trances of age. In both moods he is
useless.<br>
 If you get angry with him, he refers to some Sahib dead and
buried<br>
 these thirty years, and says that when he was in that
Sahib's<br>
 service not a khansamah in the Province could touch him. Then
he<br>
 jabbers and mows and trembles and fidgets among the dishes, and
you<br>
 repent of your irritation.</p>

<p>In these dak-bungalows, ghosts are most likely to be found,
and<br>
 when found, they should be made a note of. Not long ago it was
my<br>
 business to live in dak-bungalows. I never inhabited the
same<br>
 house for three nights running, and grew to be learned in
the<br>
 breed. I lived in Government-built ones with red brick walls
and<br>
 rail ceilings, an inventory of the furniture posted in every
room,<br>
 and an excited snake at the threshold to give welcome. I lived
in<br>
 "converted" ones--old houses officiating as
dak-bungalows--where<br>
 nothing was in its proper place and there wasn't even a fowl
for<br>
 dinner. I lived in second-hand palaces where the wind blew
through<br>
 open-work marble tracery just as uncomfortably as through a
broken<br>
 pane. I lived in dak-bungalows where the last entry in the<br>
 visitors' book was fifteen months old, and where they slashed
off<br>
 the curry-kid's head with a sword. It was my good luck to meet
all<br>
 sorts of men, from sober traveling missionaries and
deserters<br>
 flying from British Regiments, to drunken loafers who threw
whisky<br>
 bottles at all who passed; and my still greater good fortune
just<br>
 to escape a maternity case. Seeing that a fair proportion of
the<br>
 tragedy of our lives out here acted itself in dak-bungalows,
I<br>
 wondered that I had met no ghosts. A ghost that would
voluntarily<br>
 hang about a dak-bungalow would be mad of course; but so many
men<br>
 have died mad in dak-bungalows that there must be a fair
percentage<br>
 of lunatic ghosts.</p>

<p>In due time I found my ghost, or ghosts rather, for there were
two<br>
 of them. Up till that hour I had sympathized with Mr.
Besant's<br>
 method of handling them, as shown in "The Strange Case of
Mr.<br>
 Lucraft and Other Stories." I am now in the Opposition.</p>

<p>We will call the bungalow Katmal dak-bungalow. But THAT was
the<br>
 smallest part of the horror. A man with a sensitive hide has
no<br>
 right to sleep in dak-bungalows. He should marry. Katmal
dak-<br>
 bungalow was old and rotten and unrepaired. The floor was of
worn<br>
 brick, the walls were filthy, and the windows were nearly
black<br>
 with grime. It stood on a bypath largely used by native
Sub-Deputy<br>
 Assistants of all kinds, from Finance to Forests; but real
Sahibs<br>
 were rare. The khansamah, who was nearly bent double with old
age,<br>
 said so.</p>

<p>When I arrived, there was a fitful, undecided rain on the face
of<br>
 the land, accompanied by a restless wind, and every gust made
a<br>
 noise like the rattling of dry bones in the stiff toddy
palms<br>
 outside. The khansamah completely lost his head on my arrival.
He<br>
 had served a Sahib once. Did I know that Sahib? He gave me
the<br>
 name of a well-known man who has been buried for more than a<br>
 quarter of a century, and showed me an ancient daguerreotype
of<br>
 that man in his prehistoric youth. I had seen a steel engraving
of<br>
 him at the head of a double volume of Memoirs a month before,
and I<br>
 felt ancient beyond telling.</p>

<p>The day shut in and the khansamah went to get me food. He did
not<br>
 go through the pretense of calling it "khana"--man's victuals.
He<br>
 said "ratub," and that means, among other things,
"grub"--dog's<br>
 rations. There was no insult in his choice of the term. He
had<br>
 forgotten the other word, I suppose.</p>

<p>While he was cutting up the dead bodies of animals, I
settled<br>
 myself down, after exploring the dak-bungalow. There were
three<br>
 rooms, beside my own, which was a corner kennel, each giving
into<br>
 the other through dingy white doors fastened with long iron
bars.<br>
 The bungalow was a very solid one, but the partition walls of
the<br>
 rooms were almost jerry-built in their flimsiness. Every step
or<br>
 bang of a trunk echoed from my room down the other three, and
every<br>
 footfall came back tremulously from the far walls. For this
reason<br>
 I shut the door. There were no lamps--only candles in long
glass<br>
 shades. An oil wick was set in the bathroom.</p>

<p>For bleak, unadulterated misery that dak-bungalow was the
worst of<br>
 the many that I had ever set foot in. There was no fireplace,
and<br>
 the windows would not open; so a brazier of charcoal would
have<br>
 been useless. The rain and the wind splashed and gurgled and<br>
 moaned round the house, and the toddy palms rattled and
roared.<br>
 Half a dozen jackals went through the compound singing, and a
hyena<br>
 stood afar off and mocked them. A hyena would convince a
Sadducee<br>
 of the Resurrection of the Dead--the worst sort of Dead. Then
came<br>
 the ratub--a curious meal, half native and half English in<br>
 composition--with the old khansamah babbling behind my chair
about<br>
 dead and gone English people, and the wind-blown candles
playing<br>
 shadow-bo-peep with the bed and the mosquito-curtains. It was
just<br>
 the sort of dinner and evening to make a man think of every
single<br>
 one of his past sins, and of all the others that he intended
to<br>
 commit if he lived.</p>

<p>Sleep, for several hundred reasons, was not easy. The lamp in
the<br>
 bath-room threw the most absurd shadows into the room, and the
wind<br>
 was beginning to talk nonsense.</p>

<p>Just when the reasons were drowsy with blood-sucking I heard
the<br>
 regular--"Let--us--take--and--heave--him--over" grunt of
doolie-<br>
 bearers in the compound. First one doolie came in, then a
second,<br>
 and then a third. I heard the doolies dumped on the ground,
and<br>
 the shutter in front of my door shook. "That's some one trying
to<br>
 come in," I said. But no one spoke, and I persuaded myself that
it<br>
 was the gusty wind. The shutter of the room next to mine was<br>
 attacked, flung back, and the inner door opened. "That's some
Sub-<br>
 Deputy Assistant," I said, "and he has brought his friends
with<br>
 him. Now they'll talk and spit and smoke for an hour."</p>

<p>But there were no voices and no footsteps. No one was putting
his<br>
 luggage into the next room. The door shut, and I thanked<br>
 Providence that I was to be left in peace. But I was curious
to<br>
 know where the doolies had gone. I got out of bed and looked
into<br>
 the darkness. There was never a sign of a doolie. Just as I
was<br>
 getting into bed again, I heard, in the next room, the sound
that<br>
 no man in his senses can possibly mistake--the whir of a
billiard<br>
 ball down the length of the slates when the striker is
stringing<br>
 for break. No other sound is like it. A minute afterwards
there<br>
 was another whir, and I got into bed. I was not
frightened--indeed<br>
 I was not. I was very curious to know what had become of the<br>
 doolies. I jumped into bed for that reason.</p>

<p><br>
 Next minute I heard the double click of a cannon and my hair
sat<br>
 up. It is a mistake to say that hair stands up. The skin of
the<br>
 head tightens and you can feel a faint, prickly, bristling all
over<br>
 the scalp. That is the hair sitting up.</p>

<p>There was a whir and a click, and both sounds could only have
been<br>
 made by one thing--a billiard ball. I argued the matter out
at<br>
 great length with myself; and the more I argued the less
probable<br>
 it seemed that one bed, one table, and two chairs--all the<br>
 furniture of the room next to mine--could so exactly duplicate
the<br>
 sounds of a game of billiards. After another cannon, a
three-<br>
 cushion one to judge by the whir, I argued no more. I had found
my<br>
 ghost and would have given worlds to have escaped from that
dak-<br>
 bungalow. I listened, and with each listen the game grew
clearer.<br>
 There was whir on whir and click on click. Sometimes there was
a<br>
 double click and a whir and another click. Beyond any sort
of<br>
 doubt, people were playing billiards in the next room. And
the<br>
 next room was not big enough to hold a billiard table!</p>

<p>Between the pauses of the wind I heard the game go
forward--stroke<br>
 after stroke. I tried to believe that I could not hear voices;
but<br>
 that attempt was a failure.</p>

<p>Do you know what fear is? Not ordinary fear of insult, injury
or<br>
 death, but abject, quivering dread of something that you
cannot<br>
 see--fear that dries the inside of the mouth and half of the<br>
 throat--fear that makes you sweat on the palms of the hands,
and<br>
 gulp in order to keep the uvula at work? This is a fine
Fear--a<br>
 great cowardice, and must be felt to be appreciated. The
very<br>
 improbability of billiards in a dak-bungalow proved the reality
of<br>
 the thing. No man--drunk or sober--could imagine a game at<br>
 billiards, or invent the spitting crack of a "screw-cannon."</p>

<p>A severe course of dak-bungalows has this disadvantage--it
breeds<br>
 infinite credulity. If a man said to a confirmed
dak-bungalow-<br>
 haunter:--"There is a corpse in the next room, and there's a
mad<br>
 girl in the next but one, and the woman and man on that camel
have<br>
 just eloped from a place sixty miles away," the hearer would
not<br>
 disbelieve because he would know that nothing is too wild,<br>
 grotesque, or horrible to happen in a dak-bungalow.</p>

<p>This credulity, unfortunately, extends to ghosts. A
rational<br>
 person fresh from his own house would have turned on his side
and<br>
 slept. I did not. So surely as I was given up as a bad carcass
by<br>
 the scores of things in the bed because the bulk of my blood was
in<br>
 my heart, so surely did I hear every stroke of a long game
at<br>
 billiards played in the echoing room behind the iron-barred
door.<br>
 My dominant fear was that the players might want a marker. It
was<br>
 an absurd fear; because creatures who could play in the dark
would<br>
 be above such superfluities. I only know that that was my
terror;<br>
 and it was real.</p>

<p>After a long, long while the game stopped, and the door
banged. I<br>
 slept because I was dead tired. Otherwise I should have
preferred<br>
 to have kept awake. Not for everything in Asia would I have<br>
 dropped the door-bar and peered into the dark of the next
room.</p>

<p>When the morning came, I considered that I had done well
and<br>
 wisely, and inquired for the means of departure.</p>

<p>"By the way, khansamah," I said, "what were those three
doolies<br>
 doing in my compound in the night?"</p>

<p>"There were no doolies," said the khansamah.</p>

<p>I went into the next room and the daylight streamed through
the<br>
 open door. I was immensely brave. I would, at that hour,
have<br>
 played Black Pool with the owner of the big Black Pool down
below.</p>

<p>"Has this place always been a dak-bungalow?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," said the khansamah. "Ten or twenty years ago, I have<br>
 forgotten how long, it was a billiard room."</p>

<p>"A how much?"</p>

<p>"A billiard room for the Sahibs who built the Railway. I
was<br>
 khansamah then in the big house where all the Railway-Sahibs
lived,<br>
 and I used to come across with brandy-shrab. These three
rooms<br>
 were all one, and they held a big table on which the Sahibs
played<br>
 every evening. But the Sahibs are all dead now, and the
Railway<br>
 runs, you say, nearly to Kabul."</p>

<p>"Do you remember anything about the Sahibs?"</p>

<p>"It is long ago, but I remember that one Sahib, a fat man
and<br>
 always angry, was playing here one night, and he said to
me:--<br>
 'Mangal Khan, brandy-pani do,' and I filled the glass, and he
bent<br>
 over the table to strike, and his head fell lower and lower till
it<br>
 hit the table, and his spectacles came off, and when we--the
Sahibs<br>
 and I myself--ran to lift him he was dead. I helped to carry
him<br>
 out. Aha, he was a strong Sahib! But he is dead and I, old
Mangal<br>
 Khan, am still living, by your favor."</p>

<p>That was more than enough! I had my ghost--a firsthand,<br>
 authenticated article. I would write to the Society for
Psychical<br>
 Research--I would paralyze the Empire with the news! But I
would,<br>
 first of all, put eighty miles of assessed crop land between
myself<br>
 and that dak-bungalow before nightfall. The Society might
send<br>
 their regular agent to investigate later on.</p>

<p>I went into my own room and prepared to pack after noting down
the<br>
 facts of the case. As I smoked I heard the game begin
again,--with<br>
 a miss in balk this time, for the whir was a short one.</p>

<p>The door was open and I could see into the room.
Click--c1ick!<br>
 That was a cannon. I entered the room without fear, for there
was<br>
 sunlight within and a fresh breeze without. The unseen game
was<br>
 going on at a tremendous rate. And well it might, when a
restless<br>
 little rat was running to and fro inside the dingy
ceiling-cloth,<br>
 and a piece of loose window-sash was making fifty breaks off
the<br>
 window-bolt as it shook in the breeze!</p>

<p>Impossible to mistake the sound of billiard balls! Impossible
to<br>
 mistake the whir of a ball over the slate! But I was to be<br>
 excused. Even when I shut my enlightened eyes the sound was<br>
 marvelously like that of a fast game.</p>

<p>Entered angrily the faithful partner of my sorrows, Kadir
Baksh.</p>

<p>"This bungalow is very bad and low-caste! No wonder the
Presence<br>
 was disturbed and is speckled. Three sets of doolie-bearers
came<br>
 to the bungalow late last night when I was sleeping outside,
and<br>
 said that it was their custom to rest in the rooms set apart
for<br>
 the English people! What honor has the khansamah? They tried
to<br>
 enter, but I told them to go. No wonder, if these Oorias have
been<br>
 here, that the Presence is sorely spotted. It is shame, and
the<br>
 work of a dirty man!"</p>

<p>Kadir Baksh did not say that he had taken from each gang two
annas<br>
 for rent in advance, and then, beyond my earshot, had beaten
them<br>
 with the big green umbrella whose use I could never before
divine.<br>
 But Kadir Baksh has no notions of morality.</p>

<p>There was an interview with the khansamah, but as he promptly
lost<br>
 his head, wrath gave place to pity, and pity led to a long<br>
 conversation, in the course of which he put the fat
Engineer-<br>
 Sahib's tragic death in three separate stations--two of them
fifty<br>
 miles away. The third shift was to Calcutta, and there the
Sahib<br>
 died while driving a dogcart.</p>

<p>If I had encouraged him the khansamah would have wandered
all<br>
 through Bengal with his corpse.</p>

<p>I did not go away as soon as I intended. I stayed for the
night,<br>
 while the wind and the rat and the sash and the window-bolt
played<br>
 a ding-dong "hundred and fifty up." Then the wind ran out and
the<br>
 billiards stopped, and I felt that I had ruined my one
genuine,<br>
 hall-marked ghost story.</p>

<p>Had I only stopped at the proper time, I could have made
ANYTHING<br>
 out of it.</p>

<p>That was the bitterest thought of all!</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>THE SENDING OF DANA DA</h2>

<p><br>
 When the Devil rides on your chest, remember the chamar.<br>
 --Native Proverb.</p>

<p><br>
 Once upon a time some people in India made a new heaven and a
new<br>
 earth out of broken teacups, a missing brooch or two, and a
hair<br>
 brush. These were hidden under bushes, or stuffed into holes
in<br>
 the hillside, and an entire civil service of subordinate gods
used<br>
 to find or mend them again; and everyone said: "There are
more<br>
 things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our
philosophy."<br>
 Several other things happened also, but the religion never
seemed<br>
 to get much beyond its first manifestations; though it added
an<br>
 air-line postal dak, and orchestral effects in order to keep<br>
 abreast of the times, and stall off competition.</p>

<p><br>
 This religion was too elastic for ordinary use. It stretched<br>
 itself and embraced pieces of everything that medicine men of
all<br>
 ages have manufactured. It approved and stole from
Freemasonry;<br>
 looted the Latter-day Rosicrucians of half their pet words;
took<br>
 any fragments of Egyptian philosophy that it found in the<br>
 Encyclopaedia Britannica; annexed as many of the Vedas as had
been<br>
 translated into French or English, and talked of all the
rest;<br>
 built in the German versions of what is left of the Zend
Avesta;<br>
 encouraged white, gray, and black magic, including
Spiritualism,<br>
 palmistry, fortune-telling by cards, hot chestnuts,
double-kerneled<br>
 nuts and tallow droppings; would have adopted Voodoo and Oboe
had<br>
 it known anything about them, and showed itself, in every way,
one<br>
 of the most accommodating arrangements that had ever been
invented<br>
 since the birth of the sea.</p>

<p>When it was in thorough working order, with all the machinery
down<br>
 to the subscriptions complete, Dana Da came from nowhere,
with<br>
 nothing in his hands, and wrote a chapter in its history which
has<br>
 hitherto been unpublished. He said that his first name was
Dana,<br>
 and his second was Da. Now, setting aside Dana of the New
York<br>
 Sun, Dana is a Bhil name, and Da fits no native of India unless
you<br>
 accept the Bengali De as the original spelling. Da is Lap or<br>
 Finnish; and Dana Da was neither Finn, Chin, Bhil, Bengali,
Lap,<br>
 Nair, Gond, Romaney, Magh, Bokhariot, Kurd, Armenian,
Levantine,<br>
 Jew, Persian, Punjabi, Madrasi, Parsee, nor anything else known
to<br>
 ethnologists. He was simply Dana Da, and declined to give
further<br>
 information. For the sake of brevity, and as roughly
indicating<br>
 his origin, he was called "The Native." He might have been
the<br>
 original Old Man of the Mountains, who is said to be the
only<br>
 authorized head of the Teacup Creed. Some, people said that
he<br>
 was; but Dana Da used to smile and deny any connection with
the<br>
 cult; explaining that he was an "independent experimenter."</p>

<p>As I have said, he came from nowhere, with his hands behind
his<br>
 back, and studied the creed for three weeks; sitting at the feet
of<br>
 those best competent to explain its mysteries. Then he
laughed<br>
 aloud and went away, but the laugh might have been either of<br>
 devotion or derision.</p>

<p>When he returned he was without money, but his pride was
unabated.<br>
 He declared that he knew more about the things in heaven and
earth<br>
 than those who taught him, and for this contumacy was
abandoned<br>
 altogether.</p>

<p>His next appearance in public life was at a big cantonment in
Upper<br>
 India, and he was then telling fortunes with the help of
three<br>
 leaden dice, a very dirty old cloth, and a little tin box of
opium<br>
 pills. He told better fortunes when he was allowed half a
bottle<br>
 of whisky; but the things which he invented on the opium were
quite<br>
 worth the money. He was in reduced circumstances. Among
other<br>
 people's he told the fortune of an Englishman who had once
been<br>
 interested in the Simla creed, but who, later on, had married
and<br>
 forgotten all his old knowledge in the study of babies and<br>
 Exchange. The Englishman allowed Dana Da to tell a fortune
for<br>
 charity's sake, and gave him five rupees, a dinner, and some
old<br>
 clothes. When he had eaten, Dana Da professed gratitude, and
asked<br>
 if there were anything he could do for his host--in the
esoteric<br>
 line.</p>

<p>"Is there anyone that you love?" said Dana Da. The
Englishman<br>
 loved his wife, but had no desire to drag her name into the<br>
 conversation. He therefore shook his head.</p>

<p>"Is there anyone that you hate?" said Dana Da. The Englishman
said<br>
 that there were several men whom he hated deeply.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Dana Da, upon whom the whisky and the opium
were<br>
 beginning to tell. "Only give me their names, and I will
dispatch<br>
 a Sending to them and kill them."</p>

<p>Now a Sending is a horrible arrangement, first invented, they
say,<br>
 in Iceland. It is a thing sent by a wizard, and may take any
form,<br>
 but most generally wanders about the land in the shape of a
little<br>
 purple cloud till it finds the sendee, and him it kills by
changing<br>
 into the form of a horse, or a cat, or a man without a face. It
is<br>
 not strictly a native patent, though chamars can, if
irritated,<br>
 dispatch a Sending which sits on the breast of their enemy by
night<br>
 and nearly kills him. Very few natives care to irritate
chamars<br>
 for this reason.</p>

<p>"Let me dispatch a Sending," said Dana Da; "I am nearly dead
now<br>
 with want, and drink, and opium; but I should like to kill a
man<br>
 before I die. I can send a Sending anywhere you choose, and in
any<br>
 form except in the shape of a man."</p>

<p>The Englishman had no friends that he wished to kill, but
partly to<br>
 soothe Dana Da, whose eyes were rolling, and partly to see
what<br>
 would be done, he asked whether a modified Sending could not
be<br>
 arranged for--such a Sending as should make a man's life a
burden<br>
 to him, and yet do him no harm. If this were possible, he
notified<br>
 his willingness to give Dana Da ten rupees for the job.</p>

<p>"I am not what I was once," said Dana Da, "and I must take
the<br>
 money because I am poor. To what Englishman shall I send
it?"</p>

<p>"Send a Sending to Lone Sahib," said the Englishman, naming a
man<br>
 who had been most bitter in rebuking him for his apostasy from
the<br>
 Teacup Creed. Dana Da laughed and nodded.</p>

<p>"I could have chosen no better man myself," said he. "I will
see<br>
 that he finds the Sending about his path and about his bed."</p>

<p>He lay down on the hearthrug, turned up the whites of his
eyes,<br>
 shivered all over, and began to snort. This was magic, or
opium,<br>
 or the Sending, or all three. When he opened his eyes he
vowed<br>
 that the Sending had started upon the warpath, and was at
that<br>
 moment flying up to the town where Lone Sahib lives.</p>

<p>"Give me my ten rupees," said Dana Da, wearily, "and write a
letter<br>
 to Lone Sahib, telling him, and all who believe with him, that
you<br>
 and a friend are using a power greater than theirs. They will
see<br>
 that you are speaking the truth."</p>

<p>He departed unsteadily, with the promise of some more rupees
if<br>
 anything came of the Sending.</p>

<p>The Englishman sent a letter to Lone Sahib, couched in what
he<br>
 remembered of the terminology of the creed. He wrote: "I also,
in<br>
 the days of what you held to be my backsliding, have
obtained<br>
 enlightenment, and with enlightenment has come power." Then
he<br>
 grew so deeply mysterious that the recipient of the letter
could<br>
 make neither head nor tail of it, and was proportionately<br>
 impressed; for he fancied that his friend had become a
"fifth<br>
 rounder." When a man is a "fifth rounder" he can do more
than<br>
 Slade and Houdin combined.</p>

<p>Lone Sahib read the letter in five different fashions, and
was<br>
 beginning a sixth interpretation, when his bearer dashed in
with<br>
 the news that there was a cat on the bed. Now, if there was
one<br>
 thing that Lone Sahib hated more than another it was a cat.
He<br>
 rated the bearer for not turning it out of the house. The
bearer<br>
 said that he was afraid. All the doors of the bedroom had
been<br>
 shut throughout the morning, and no real cat could possibly
have<br>
 entered the room. He would prefer not to meddle with the
creature.</p>

<p>Lone Sahib entered the room gingerly, and there, on the pillow
of<br>
 his bed, sprawled and whimpered a wee white kitten, not a
jumpsome,<br>
 frisky little beast, but a sluglike crawler with its eyes
barely<br>
 opened and its paws lacking strength or direction--a kitten
that<br>
 ought to have been in a basket with its mamma. Lone Sahib
caught<br>
 it by the scruff of its neck, handed it over to the sweeper to
be<br>
 drowned, and fined the bearer four annas.</p>

<p>That evening, as he was reading in his room, he fancied that
he saw<br>
 something moving about on the hearthrug, outside the circle
of<br>
 light from his reading lamp. When the thing began to myowl,
he<br>
 realized that it was a kitten--a wee white kitten, nearly blind
and<br>
 very miserable. He was seriously angry, and spoke bitterly to
his<br>
 bearer, who said that there was no kitten in the room when
he<br>
 brought in the lamp, and real kittens of tender age generally
had<br>
 mother cats in attendance.</p>

<p>"If the Presence will go out into the veranda and listen,"
said the<br>
 bearer, "he will hear no cats. How, therefore, can the kitten
on<br>
 the bed and the kitten on the hearthrug be real kittens?"</p>

<p>Lone Sahib went out to listen, and the bearer followed him,
but<br>
 there was no sound of Rachel mewing for her children. He
returned<br>
 to his room, having hurled the kitten down the hillside, and
wrote<br>
 out the incidents of the day for the benefit of his
coreligionists.<br>
 Those people were so absolutely free from superstition that
they<br>
 ascribed anything a little out of the common to agencies. As
it<br>
 was their business to know all about the agencies, they were
on<br>
 terms of almost indecent familiarity with manifestations of
every<br>
 kind. Their letters dropped from the
ceiling--un-stamped--and<br>
 spirits used to squatter up and down their staircases all
night.<br>
 But they had never come into contact with kittens. Lone
Sahib<br>
 wrote out the facts, noting the hour and the minute, as
every<br>
 psychical observer is bound to do, and appending the
Englishman's<br>
 letter because it was the most mysterious document and might
have<br>
 had a bearing upon anything in this world or the next. An
outsider<br>
 would have translated all the tangle thus: "Look out! You
laughed<br>
 at me once, and now I am going to make you sit up."</p>

<p>Lone Sahib's coreligionists found that meaning in it; but
their<br>
 translation was refined and full of four-syllable words. They
held<br>
 a sederunt, and were filled with tremulous joy, for, in spite
of<br>
 their familiarity with all the other worlds and cycles, they had
a<br>
 very human awe of things sent from ghostland. They met in
Lone<br>
 Sahib's room in shrouded and sepulchral gloom, and their
conclave<br>
 was broken up by a clinking among the photo frames on the<br>
 mantelpiece. A wee white kitten, nearly blind, was looping
and<br>
 writhing itself between the clock and the candlesticks. That<br>
 stopped all investigations or doubtings. Here was the<br>
 manifestation in the flesh. It was, so far as could be seen,<br>
 devoid of purpose, but it was a manifestation of undoubted<br>
 authenticity.</p>

<p>They drafted a round robin to the Englishman, the backslider
of old<br>
 days, adjuring him in the interests of the creed to explain
whether<br>
 there was any connection between the embodiment of some
Egyptian<br>
 god or other (I have forgotten the name) and his
communication.<br>
 They called the kitten Ra, or Toth, or Shem, or Noah, or
something;<br>
 and when Lone Sahib confessed that the first one had, at his
most<br>
 misguided instance, been drowned by the sweeper, they said<br>
 consolingly that in his next life he would be a "bounder," and
not<br>
 even a "rounder" of the lowest grade. These words may not be
quite<br>
 correct, but they express the sense of the house accurately.</p>

<p>When the Englishman received the round robin--it came by
post--he<br>
 was startled and bewildered. He sent into the bazaar for Dana
Da,<br>
 who read the letter and laughed. "That is my Sending," said
he.<br>
 "I told you I would work well. Now give me another ten
rupees."</p>

<p>"But what in the world is this gibberish about Egyptian
gods?"<br>
 asked the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Cats," said Dana Da, with a hiccough, for he had discovered
the<br>
 Englishman's whisky bottle. "Cats and cats and cats! Never
was<br>
 such a Sending. A hundred of cats. Now give me ten more
rupees<br>
 and write as I dictate."</p>

<p>Dana Da's letter was a curiosity. It bore the Englishman's<br>
 signature, and hinted at cats--at a Sending of cats. The
mere<br>
 words on paper were creepy and uncanny to behold.</p>

<p>"What have you done, though?" said the Englishman; "I am as
much in<br>
 the dark as ever. Do you mean to say that you can actually
send<br>
 this absurd Sending you talk about?"</p>

<p>"Judge for yourself," said Dana Da. "What does that letter
mean?<br>
 In a little time they will all be at my feet and yours, and I,
oh,<br>
 glory! will be drugged or drunk all day long."</p>

<p>Dana Da knew his people.</p>

<p>When a man who hates cats wakes up in the morning and finds
a<br>
 little squirming kitten on his breast, or puts his hand into
his<br>
 ulster pocket and finds a little half-dead kitten where his
gloves<br>
 should be, or opens his trunk and finds a vile kitten among
his<br>
 dress shirts, or goes for a long ride with his mackintosh
strapped<br>
 on his saddle-bow and shakes a little sprawling kitten from
its<br>
 folds when he opens it, or goes out to dinner and finds a
little<br>
 blind kitten under his chair, or stays at home and finds a
writhing<br>
 kitten under the quilt, or wriggling among his boots, or
hanging,<br>
 head downward, in his tobacco jar, or being mangled by his
terrier<br>
 in the veranda--when such a man finds one kitten, neither more
nor<br>
 less, once a day in a place where no kitten rightly could or
should<br>
 be, he is naturally upset. When he dare not murder his daily
trove<br>
 because he believes it to be a manifestation, an emissary,
an<br>
 embodiment, and half a dozen other things all out of the
regular<br>
 course of nature, he is more than upset. He is actually<br>
 distressed. Some of Lone Sahib's coreligionists thought that
he<br>
 was a highly favored individual; but many said that if he
had<br>
 treated the first kitten with proper respect--as suited a
Toth-Ra<br>
 Tum-Sennacherib Embodiment--all his trouble would have been<br>
 averted. They compared him to the Ancient Mariner, but none
the<br>
 less they were proud of him and proud of the Englishman who
had<br>
 sent the manifestation. They did not call it a Sending
because<br>
 Icelandic magic was not in their programme.</p>

<p>After sixteen kittens--that is to say, after one fortnight,
for<br>
 there were three kittens on the first day to impress the fact
of<br>
 the Sending, the whole camp was uplifted by a letter--it
came<br>
 flying through a window--from the Old Man of the
Mountains--the<br>
 head of all the creed--explaining the manifestation in the
most<br>
 beautiful language and soaking up all the credit of it for
himself.<br>
 The Englishman, said the letter, was not there at all. He was
a<br>
 backslider without power or asceticism, who couldn't even raise
a<br>
 table by force of volition, much less project an army of
kittens<br>
 through space. The entire arrangement, said the letter, was<br>
 strictly orthodox, worked and sanctioned by the highest
authorities<br>
 within the pale of the creed. There was great joy at this,
for<br>
 some of the weaker brethren seeing that an outsider who had
been<br>
 working on independent lines could create kittens, whereas
their<br>
 own rulers had never gone beyond crockery--and broken at
that--were<br>
 showing a desire to break line on their own trail. In fact,
there<br>
 was the promise of a schism. A second round robin was drafted
to<br>
 the Englishman, beginning: "Oh, Scoffer," and ending with a<br>
 selection of curses from the rites of Mizraim and Memphis and
the<br>
 Commination of Jugana; who was a "fifth rounder," upon whose
name<br>
 an upstart "third rounder" once traded. A papal excommunication
is<br>
 a billet-doux compared to the Commination of Jugana. The<br>
 Englishman had been proved under the hand and seal of the Old
Man<br>
 of the Mountains to have appropriated virtue and pretended to
have<br>
 power which, in reality, belonged only to the supreme head.<br>
 Naturally the round robin did not spare him.</p>

<p>He handed the letter to Dana Da to translate into decent
English.<br>
 The effect on Dana Da was curious. At first he was furiously<br>
 angry, and then he laughed for five minutes.</p>

<p>"I had thought," he said, "that they would have come to me.
In<br>
 another week I would have shown that I sent the Sending, and
they<br>
 would have discrowned the Old Man of the Mountains who has
sent<br>
 this Sending of mine. Do you do nothing. The time has come for
me<br>
 to act. Write as I dictate, and I will put them to shame.
But<br>
 give me ten more rupees."</p>

<p>At Dana Da's dictation the Englishman wrote nothing less than
a<br>
 formal challenge to the Old Man of the Mountains. It wound
up:<br>
 "And if this manifestation be from your hand, then let it go<br>
 forward; but if it be from my hand, I will that the Sending
shall<br>
 cease in two days' time. On that day there shall be twelve
kittens<br>
 and thenceforward none at all. The people shall judge between
us."<br>
 This was signed by Dana Da, who added pentacles and pentagrams,
and<br>
 a crux ansata, and half a dozen swastikas, and a Triple Tau to
his<br>
 name, just to show that he was all he laid claim to be.</p>

<p>The challenge was read out to the gentlemen and ladies, and
they<br>
 remembered then that Dana Da had laughed at them some years
ago.<br>
 It was officially announced that the Old Man of the Mountains
would<br>
 treat the matter with contempt; Dana Da being an independent<br>
 investigator without a single "round" at the back of him. But
this<br>
 did not soothe his people. They wanted to see a fight. They
were<br>
 very human for all their spirituality. Lone Sahib, who was
really<br>
 being worn out with kittens, submitted meekly to his fate. He
felt<br>
 that he was being "kittened to prove the power of Dana Da," as
the<br>
 poet says.</p>

<p>When the stated day dawned, the shower of kittens began. Some
were<br>
 white and some were tabby, and all were about the same
loathsome<br>
 age. Three were on his hearth-rug, three in his bathroom, and
the<br>
 other six turned up at intervals among the visitors who came to
see<br>
 the prophecy break down. Never was a more satisfactory
Sending.<br>
 On the next day there were no kittens, and the next day and all
the<br>
 other days were kittenless and quiet. The people murmured
and<br>
 looked to the Old Man of the Mountains for an explanation. A<br>
 letter, written on a palm leaf, dropped from the ceiling,
but<br>
 everyone except Lone Sahib felt that letters were not what
the<br>
 occasion demanded. There should have been cats, there should
have<br>
 been cats--full-grown ones. The letter proved conclusively
that<br>
 there had been a hitch in the psychic current which, colliding
with<br>
 a dual identity, had interfered with the percipient activity
all<br>
 along the main line. The kittens were still going on, but owing
to<br>
 some failure in the developing fluid, they were not
materialized.<br>
 The air was thick with letters for a few days afterwards.
Unseen<br>
 hands played Gluck and Beethoven on finger-bowls and clock
shades;<br>
 but all men felt that psychic life was a mockery without<br>
 materialized kittens. Even Lone Sahib shouted with the majority
on<br>
 this head. Dana Da's letters were very insulting, and if he
had<br>
 then offered to lead a new departure, there is no knowing
what<br>
 might not have happened.</p>

<p>But Dana Da was dying of whisky and opium in the Englishman's
go-<br>
 down, and had small heart for new creeds.</p>

<p>"They have been put to shame," said he. "Never was such a
Sending.<br>
 It has killed me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said the Englishman, "you are going to die, Dana
Da,<br>
 and that sort of stuff must be left behind. I'll admit that
you<br>
 have made some queer things come about. Tell me honestly, now,
how<br>
 was it done?"</p>

<p>"Give me ten more rupees," said Dana Da, faintly, "and if I
die<br>
 before I spend them, bury them with me." The silver was
counted<br>
 out while Dana Da was fighting with death. His hand closed
upon<br>
 the money and he smiled a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Bend low," he whispered. The Englishman bent.</p>

<p>"Bunnia--mission school--expelled--box-wallah
(peddler)--Ceylon<br>
 pearl merchant--all mine English education--outcasted, and made
up<br>
 name Dana Da--England with American thought-reading man
and--and--<br>
 you gave me ten rupees several times--I gave the Sahib's
bearer<br>
 two-eight a month for cats--little, little cats. I wrote, and
he<br>
 put them about--very clever man. Very few kittens now in the<br>
 bazaar. Ask Lone Sahib's sweeper's wife."</p>

<p>So saying, Dana Da gasped and passed away into a land where,
if all<br>
 be true, there are no materializations and the making of new
creeds<br>
 is discouraged.</p>

<p>But consider the gorgeous simplicity of it all!</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>IN THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO</h2>

<p><br>
 A stone's throw out on either hand<br>
 From that well-ordered road we tread,<br>
 And all the world is wild and strange;<br>
 Churel and ghoul and Djinn and sprite<br>
 Shall bear us company to-night,<br>
 For we have reached the Oldest Land<br>
 Wherein the Powers of Darkness range.</p>

<p>From the Dusk to the Dawn.</p>

<p><br>
 The house of Suddhoo, near the Taksali Gate, is two-storied,
with<br>
 four carved windows of old brown wood, and a flat roof. You
may<br>
 recognize it by five red hand-prints arranged like the Five
of<br>
 Diamonds on the whitewash between the upper windows. Bhagwan
Dass,<br>
 the bunnia, and a man who says he gets his living by
seal-cutting,<br>
 live in the lower story with a troop of wives, servants,
friends,<br>
 and retainers. The two upper rooms used to be occupied by
Janoo<br>
 and Azizun and a little black-and-tan terrier that was stolen
from<br>
 an Englishman's house and given to Janoo by a soldier.
To-day,<br>
 only Janoo lives in the upper rooms. Suddhoo sleeps on the
roof<br>
 generally, except when he sleeps in the street. He used to go
to<br>
 Peshawar in the cold weather to visit his son, who sells<br>
 curiosities near the Edwardes' Gate, and then he slept under a
real<br>
 mud roof. Suddhoo is a great friend of mine, because his cousin
had<br>
 a son who secured, thanks to my recommendation, the post of
head-<br>
 messenger to a big firm in the Station. Suddhoo says that God
will<br>
 make me a Lieutenant-Governor one of these days. I daresay
his<br>
 prophecy will come true. He is very, very old, with white hair
and<br>
 no teeth worth showing, and he has outlived his
wits--outlived<br>
 nearly everything except his fondness for his son at
Peshawar.<br>
 Janoo and Azizun are Kashmiris, Ladies of the City, and theirs
was<br>
 an ancient and more or less honorable profession; but Azizun
has<br>
 since married a medical student from the North-West and has
settled<br>
 down to a most respectable life somewhere near Bareilly.
Bhagwan<br>
 Dass is an extortionate and an adulterator. He is very rich.
The<br>
 man who is supposed to get his living by seal-cutting pretends
to<br>
 be very poor. This lets you know as much as is necessary of
the<br>
 four principal tenants in the house of Suddhoo. Then there is
Me,<br>
 of course; but I am only the chorus that comes in at the end
to<br>
 explain things. So I do not count.</p>

<p><br>
 Suddhoo was not clever. The man who pretended to cut seals was
the<br>
 cleverest of them all--Bhagwan Dass only knew how to
lie--except<br>
 Janoo. She was also beautiful, but that was her own affair.</p>

<p>Suddhoo's son at Peshawar was attacked by pleurisy, and old
Suddhoo<br>
 was troubled. The seal-cutter man heard of Suddhoo's anxiety
and<br>
 made capital out of it. He was abreast of the times. He got
a<br>
 friend in Peshawar to telegraph daily accounts of the son's
health.<br>
 And here the story begins.</p>

<p>Suddhoo's cousin's son told me, one evening, that Suddhoo
wanted to<br>
 see me; that he was too old and feeble to come personally, and
that<br>
 I should be conferring an everlasting honor on the House of
Suddhoo<br>
 if I went to him. I went; but I think, seeing how well-off
Suddhoo<br>
 was then, that he might have sent something better than an
ekka,<br>
 which jolted fearfully, to haul out a future Lieutenant-Governor
to<br>
 the City on a muggy April evening. The ekka did not run
quickly.<br>
 It was full dark when we pulled up opposite the door of
Ranjit<br>
 Singh's Tomb near the main gate of the Fort. Here was Suddhoo
and<br>
 he said that, by reason of my condescension, it was
absolutely<br>
 certain that I should become a Lieutenant-Governor while my
hair<br>
 was yet black. Then we talked about the weather and the state
of<br>
 my health, and the wheat crops, for fifteen minutes, in the
Huzuri<br>
 Bagh, under the stars.</p>

<p>Suddhoo came to the point at last. He said that Janoo had told
him<br>
 that there was an order of the Sirkar against magic, because it
was<br>
 feared that magic might one day kill the Empress of India. I<br>
 didn't know anything about the state of the law; but I fancied
that<br>
 something interesting was going to happen. I said that so far
from<br>
 magic being discouraged by the Government it was highly
commended.<br>
 The greatest officials of the State practiced it themselves.
(If<br>
 the Financial Statement isn't magic, I don't know what is.)
Then,<br>
 to encourage him further, I said that, if there was any
jadoo<br>
 afoot, I had not the least objection to giving it my
countenance<br>
 and sanction, and to seeing that it was clean jadoo--white
magic,<br>
 as distinguished from the unclean jadoo which kills folk. It
took<br>
 a long time before Suddhoo admitted that this was just what he
had<br>
 asked me to come for. Then he told me, in jerks and quavers,
that<br>
 the man who said he cut seals was a sorcerer of the cleanest
kind;<br>
 that every day he gave Suddhoo news of the sick son in
Peshawar<br>
 more quickly than the lightning could fly, and that this news
was<br>
 always corroborated by the letters. Further, that he had
told<br>
 Suddhoo how a great danger was threatening his son, which could
be<br>
 removed by clean jadoo; and, of course, heavy payment. I began
to<br>
 see how the land lay, and told Suddhoo that I also understood
a<br>
 little jadoo in the Western line, and would go to his house to
see<br>
 that everything was done decently and in order. We set off<br>
 together; and on the way Suddhoo told me he had paid the
seal-<br>
 cutter between one hundred and two hundred rupees already; and
the<br>
 jadoo of that night would cost two hundred more. Which was
cheap,<br>
 he said, considering the greatness of his son's danger; but I
do<br>
 not think he meant it.</p>

<p>The lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when
we<br>
 arrived. I could hear awful noises from behind the
seal-cutter's<br>
 shop-front, as if some one were groaning his soul out.
Suddhoo<br>
 shook all over, and while we groped our way upstairs told me
that<br>
 the jadoo had begun. Janoo and Azizun met us at the
stair-head,<br>
 and told us that the jadoo-work was coming off in their
rooms,<br>
 because there was more space there. Janoo is a lady of a<br>
 freethinking turn of mind. She whispered that the jadoo was
an<br>
 invention to get money out of Suddhoo, and that the
seal-cutter<br>
 would go to a hot place when he died. Suddhoo was nearly
crying<br>
 with fear and old age. He kept walking up and down the room in
the<br>
 half light, repeating his son's name over and over again,
and<br>
 asking Azizun if the seal-cutter ought not to make a reduction
in<br>
 the case of his own landlord. Janoo pulled me over to the shadow
in<br>
 the recess of the carved bow- windows. The boards were up, and
the<br>
 rooms were only lit by one tiny lamp. There was no chance of
my<br>
 being seen if I stayed still.</p>

<p>Presently, the groans below ceased, and we heard steps on
the<br>
 staircase. That was the seal-cutter. He stopped outside the
door<br>
 as the terrier barked and Azizun fumbled at the chain, and he
told<br>
 Suddhoo to blow out the lamp. This left the place in jet
darkness,<br>
 except for the red glow from the two huqas that belonged to
Janoo<br>
 and Azizun. The seal-cutter came in, and I heard Suddhoo
throw<br>
 himself down on the floor and groan. Azizun caught her breath,
and<br>
 Janoo backed to one of the beds with a shudder. There was a
clink<br>
 of something metallic, and then shot up a pale blue-green
flame<br>
 near the ground. The light was just enough to show Azizun,
pressed<br>
 against one corner of the room with the terrier between her
knees;<br>
 Janoo, with her hands clasped, leaning forward as she sat on
the<br>
 bed; Suddhoo, face down, quivering, and the seal-cutter.</p>

<p>I hope I may never see another man like that seal-cutter. He
was<br>
 stripped to the waist, with a wreath of white jasmine as thick
as<br>
 my wrist round his forehead, a salmon-colored loin-cloth round
his<br>
 middle, and a steel bangle on each ankle. This was not awe-<br>
 inspiring. It was the face of the man that turned me cold. It
was<br>
 blue-gray in the first place. In the second, the eyes were
rolled<br>
 back till you could only see the whites of them; and, in the
third,<br>
 the face was the face of a demon--a ghoul--anything you
please<br>
 except of the sleek, oily old ruffian who sat in the day-time
over<br>
 his turning-lathe downstairs. He was lying on his stomach,
with<br>
 his arms turned and crossed behind him, as if he had been
thrown<br>
 down pinioned. His head and neck were the only parts of him
off<br>
 the floor. They were nearly at right angles to the body, like
the<br>
 head of a cobra at spring. It was ghastly. In the centre of
the<br>
 room, on the bare earth floor, stood a big, deep, brass basin,
with<br>
 a pale blue-green light floating in the centre like a
night-light.<br>
 Round that basin the man on the floor wriggled himself three
times.<br>
 How he did it I do not know. I could see the muscles ripple
along<br>
 his spine and fall smooth again; but I could not see any
other<br>
 motion. The head seemed the only thing alive about him, except
that<br>
 slow curl and uncurl of the laboring back-muscles. Janoo from
the<br>
 bed was breathing seventy to the minute; Azizun held her
hands<br>
 before her eyes; and old Suddhoo, fingering at the dirt that
had<br>
 got into his white beard, was crying to himself. The horror of
it<br>
 was that the creeping, crawly thing made no sound--only
crawled!<br>
 And, remember, this lasted for ten minutes, while the
terrier<br>
 whined, and Azizun shuddered, and Janoo gasped, and Suddhoo
cried.</p>

<p>I felt the hair lift at the back of my head, and my heart
thump<br>
 like a thermantidote paddle. Luckily, the seal-cutter
betrayed<br>
 himself by his most impressive trick and made me calm again.
After<br>
 he had finished that unspeakable triple crawl, he stretched
his<br>
 head away from the floor as high as he could, and sent out a jet
of<br>
 fire from his nostrils. Now, I knew how fire-spouting is
done--I<br>
 can do it myself--so I felt at ease. The business was a fraud.
If<br>
 he had only kept to that crawl without trying to raise the
effect,<br>
 goodness knows what I might not have thought. Both the girls<br>
 shrieked at the jet of fire and the head dropped, chin down, on
the<br>
 floor with a thud; the whole body lying then like a corpse with
its<br>
 arms trussed. There was a pause of five full minutes after
this,<br>
 and the blue- green flame died down. Janoo stooped to settle
one<br>
 of her anklets, while Azizun turned her face to the wall and
took<br>
 the terrier in her arms. Suddhoo put out an arm mechanically
to<br>
 Janoo's huqa, and she slid it across the floor with her
foot.<br>
 Directly above the body and on the wall, were a couple of
flaming<br>
 portraits, in stamped paper frames, of the Queen and the Prince
of<br>
 Wales. They looked down on the performance, and, to my
thinking,<br>
 seemed to heighten the grotesqueness of it all.</p>

<p>Just when the silence was getting unendurable, the body turned
over<br>
 and rolled away from the basin to the side of the room, where
it<br>
 lay stomach up. There was a faint "plop" from the
basin--exactly<br>
 like the noise a fish makes when it takes a fly--and the
green<br>
 light in the centre revived.</p>

<p>I looked at the basin, and saw, bobbing in the water, the
dried,<br>
 shrivelled, black head of a native baby--open eyes, open mouth
and<br>
 shaved scalp. It was worse, being so very sudden, than the<br>
 crawling exhibition. We had no time to say anything before
it<br>
 began to speak.</p>

<p>Read Poe's account of the voice that came from the mesmerized
dying<br>
 man, and you will realize less than one-half of the horror of
that<br>
 head's voice.</p>

<p>There was an interval of a second or two between each word,
and a<br>
 sort of "ring, ring, ring," in the note of the voice, like
the<br>
 timbre of a bell. It pealed slowly, as if talking to itself,
for<br>
 several minutes before I got rid of my cold sweat. Then the<br>
 blessed solution struck me. I looked at the body lying near
the<br>
 doorway, and saw, just where the hollow of the throat joins on
the<br>
 shoulders, a muscle that had nothing to do with any man's
regular<br>
 breathing, twitching away steadily. The whole thing was a
careful<br>
 reproduction of the Egyptian teraphin that one read about
sometimes<br>
 and the voice was as clever and as appalling a piece of<br>
 ventriloquism as one could wish to hear. All this time the
head<br>
 was "lip-lip-lapping" against the side of the basin, and
speaking.<br>
 It told Suddhoo, on his face again whining, of his son's
illness<br>
 and of the state of the illness up to the evening of that
very<br>
 night. I always shall respect the seal-cutter for keeping so<br>
 faithfully to the time of the Peshawar telegrams. It went on
to<br>
 say that skilled doctors were night and day watching over the
man's<br>
 life; and that he would eventually recover if the fee to the
potent<br>
 sorcerer, whose servant was the head in the basin, were
doubled.</p>

<p>Here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in. To
ask<br>
 for twice your stipulated fee in a voice that Lazarus might
have<br>
 used when he rose from the dead, is absurd. Janoo, who is really
a<br>
 woman of masculine intellect, saw this as quickly as I did.
I<br>
 heard her say "Asli nahin! Fareib!" scornfully under her
breath;<br>
 and just as she said so, the light in the basin died out, the
head<br>
 stopped talking, and we heard the room door creak on its
hinges.<br>
 Then Janoo struck a match, lit the lamp, and we saw that
head,<br>
 basin, and seal- cutter were gone. Suddhoo was wringing his
hands<br>
 and explaining to any one who cared to listen, that, if his
chances<br>
 of eternal salvation depended on it, he could not raise another
two<br>
 hundred rupees. Azizun was nearly in hysterics in the
corner;<br>
 while Janoo sat down composedly on one of the beds to discuss
the<br>
 probabilities of the whole thing being a bunao, or
"make-up."</p>

<p>I explained as much as I knew of the seal-cutter's way of
jadoo;<br>
 but her argument was much more simple:--"The magic that is
always<br>
 demanding gifts is no true magic," said she. "My mother told
me<br>
 that the only potent love-spells are those which are told you
for<br>
 love. This seal-cutter man is a liar and a devil. I dare not<br>
 tell, do anything, or get anything done, because I am in debt
to<br>
 Bhagwan Dass the bunnia for two gold rings and a heavy anklet.
I<br>
 must get my food from his shop. The seal-cutter is the friend
of<br>
 Bhagwan Dass, and he would poison my food. A fool's jadoo has
been<br>
 going on for ten days, and has cost Suddhoo many rupees each
night.<br>
 The seal-cutter used black hens and lemons and mantras before.
He<br>
 never showed us anything like this till to-night. Azizun is
a<br>
 fool, and will be a pur dahnashin soon. Suddhoo has lost his<br>
 strength and his wits. See now! I had hoped to get from
Suddhoo<br>
 many rupees while he lived, and many more after his death;
and<br>
 behold, he is spending everything on that offspring of a devil
and<br>
 a she-ass, the seal- cutter!"</p>

<p>Here I said:--"But what induced Suddhoo to drag me into
the<br>
 business? Of course I can speak to the seal-cutter, and he
shall<br>
 refund. The whole thing is child's talk--shame--and
senseless."</p>

<p>"Suddhoo IS an old child," said Janoo. "He has lived on the
roofs<br>
 these seventy years and is as senseless as a milch-goat. He<br>
 brought you here to assure himself that he was not breaking any
law<br>
 of the Sirkar, whose salt he ate many years ago. He worships
the<br>
 dust off the feet of the seal-cutter, and that cow-devourer
has<br>
 forbidden him to go and see his son. What does Suddhoo know
of<br>
 your laws or the lightning-post? I have to watch his money
going<br>
 day by day to that lying beast below."</p>

<p>Janoo stamped her foot on the floor and nearly cried with
vexation;<br>
 while Suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket in the corner,
and<br>
 Azizun was trying to guide the pipe-stem to his foolish old
mouth.</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>Now the case stands thus. Unthinkingly, I have laid myself
open to<br>
 the charge of aiding and abetting the seal-cutter in
obtaining<br>
 money under false pretences, which is forbidden by Section 420
of<br>
 the Indian Penal Code. I am helpless in the matter for these<br>
 reasons, I cannot inform the Police. What witnesses would
support<br>
 my statements? Janoo refuses flatly, Azizun is a veiled
woman<br>
 somewhere near Bareilly--lost in this big India of ours. I
cannot<br>
 again take the law into my own hands, and speak to the
seal-cutter;<br>
 for certain am I that, not only would Suddhoo disbelieve me,
but<br>
 this step would end in the poisoning of Janoo, who is bound
hand<br>
 and foot by her debt to the bunnia. Suddhoo is an old dotard;
and<br>
 whenever we meet mumbles my idiotic joke that the Sirkar
rather<br>
 patronizes the Black Art than otherwise. His son is well now;
but<br>
 Suddhoo is completely under the influence of the seal-cutter,
by<br>
 whose advice he regulates the affairs of his life. Janoo
watches<br>
 daily the money that she hoped to wheedle out of Suddhoo taken
by<br>
 the seal-cutter, and becomes daily more furious and sullen.</p>

<p>She will never tell, because she dare not; but, unless
something<br>
 happens to prevent her, I am afraid that the seal-cutter will
die<br>
 of cholera--the white arsenic kind--about the middle of May.
And<br>
 thus I shall have to be privy to a murder in the House of
Suddhoo.</p>

<p><br>
 Shakespeare says something about worms, or it may be giants
or<br>
 beetles, turning if you tread on them too severely. The
safest<br>
 plan is never to tread on a worm--not even on the last new<br>
 subaltern from Home, with his buttons hardly out of their
tissue<br>
 paper, and the red of sappy English beef in his cheeks. This
is<br>
 the story of the worm that turned. For the sake of brevity,
we<br>
 will call Henry Augustus Ramsay Faizanne, "The Worm," although
he<br>
 really was an exceedingly pretty boy, without a hair on his
face,<br>
 and with a waist like a girl's when he came out to the
Second<br>
 "Shikarris" and was made unhappy in several ways. The
"Shikarris"<br>
 are a high-caste regiment, and you must be able to do things
well--<br>
 play a banjo or ride more than a little, or sing, or act--to get
on<br>
 with them.</p>

<p><br>
 The Worm did nothing except fall off his pony, and knock chips
out<br>
 of gate-posts with his trap. Even that became monotonous after
a<br>
 time. He objected to whist, cut the cloth at billiards, sang
out<br>
 of tune, kept very much to himself, and wrote to his Mamma
and<br>
 sisters at Home. Four of these five things were vices which
the<br>
 "Shikarris" objected to and set themselves to eradicate. Every
one<br>
 knows how subalterns are, by brother subalterns, softened and
not<br>
 permitted to be ferocious. It is good and wholesome, and does
no<br>
 one any harm, unless tempers are lost; and then there is
trouble.<br>
 There was a man once--but that is another story.</p>

<p>The "Shikarris" shikarred The Worm very much, and he bore<br>
 everything without winking. He was so good and so anxious to<br>
 learn, and flushed so pink, that his education was cut short,
and<br>
 he was left to his own devices by every one except the
Senior<br>
 Subaltern, who continued to make life a burden to The Worm.
The<br>
 Senior Subaltern meant no harm; but his chaff was coarse, and
he<br>
 didn't quite understand where to stop. He had been waiting
too<br>
 long for his company; and that always sours a man. Also he was
in<br>
 love, which made him worse.</p>

<p>One day, after he had borrowed The Worm's trap for a lady who
never<br>
 existed, had used it himself all the afternoon, had sent a note
to<br>
 The Worm purporting to come from the lady, and was telling the
Mess<br>
 all about it, The Worm rose in his place and said, in his
quiet,<br>
 ladylike voice: "That was a very pretty sell; but I'll lay you
a<br>
 month's pay to a month's pay when you get your step, that I work
a<br>
 sell on you that you'll remember for the rest of your days, and
the<br>
 Regiment after you when you're dead or broke." The Worm
wasn't<br>
 angry in the least, and the rest of the Mess shouted. Then
the<br>
 Senior Subaltern looked at The Worm from the boots upwards,
and<br>
 down again, and said, "Done, Baby." The Worm took the rest of
the<br>
 Mess to witness that the bet had been taken, and retired into
a<br>
 book with a sweet smile.</p>

<p>Two months passed, and the Senior Subaltern still educated
The<br>
 Worm, who began to move about a little more as the hot weather
came<br>
 on. I have said that the Senior Subaltern was in love. The<br>
 curious thing is that a girl was in love with the Senior
Subaltern.<br>
 Though the Colonel said awful things, and the Majors snorted,
and<br>
 married Captains looked unutterable wisdom, and the juniors<br>
 scoffed, those two were engaged.</p>

<p>The Senior Subaltern was so pleased with getting his Company
and<br>
 his acceptance at the same time that he forgot to bother The
Worm.<br>
 The girl was a pretty girl, and had money of her own. She does
not<br>
 come into this story at all.</p>

<p>One night, at the beginning of the hot weather, all the
Mess,<br>
 except The Worm, who had gone to his own room to write Home<br>
 letters, were sitting on the platform outside the Mess House.
The<br>
 Band had finished playing, but no one wanted to go in. And
the<br>
 Captains' wives were there also. The folly of a man in love
is<br>
 unlimited. The Senior Subaltern had been holding forth on
the<br>
 merits of the girl he was engaged to, and the ladies were
purring<br>
 approval, while the men yawned, when there was a rustle of
skirts<br>
 in the dark, and a tired, faint voice lifted itself:</p>

<p>"Where's my husband?"</p>

<p>I do not wish in the least to reflect on the morality of
the<br>
 "Shikarris;" but it is on record that four men jumped up as if
they<br>
 had been shot. Three of them were married men. Perhaps they
were<br>
 afraid that their wives had come from Home unbeknownst. The
fourth<br>
 said that he had acted on the impulse of the moment. He
explained<br>
 this afterwards.</p>

<p>Then the voice cried:--"Oh, Lionel!" Lionel was the Senior<br>
 Subaltern's name. A woman came into the little circle of light
by<br>
 the candles on the peg-tables, stretching out her hands to the
dark<br>
 where the Senior Subaltern was, and sobbing. We rose to our
feet,<br>
 feeling that things were going to happen and ready to believe
the<br>
 worst. In this bad, small world of ours, one knows so little
of<br>
 the life of the next man--which, after all, is entirely his
own<br>
 concern-- that one is not surprised when a crash comes.
Anything<br>
 might turn up any day for any one. Perhaps the Senior
Subaltern<br>
 had been trapped in his youth. Men are crippled that way<br>
 occasionally. We didn't know; we wanted to hear; and the
Captains'<br>
 wives were as anxious as we. If he HAD been trapped, he was to
be<br>
 excused; for the woman from nowhere, in the dusty shoes, and
gray<br>
 travelling dress, was very lovely, with black hair and great
eyes<br>
 full of tears. She was tall, with a fine figure, and her voice
had<br>
 a running sob in it pitiful to hear. As soon as the Senior<br>
 Subaltern stood up, she threw her arms round his neck, and
called<br>
 him "my darling," and said she could not bear waiting alone
in<br>
 England, and his letters were so short and cold, and she was his
to<br>
 the end of the world, and would he forgive her. This did not
sound<br>
 quite like a lady's way of speaking. It was too
demonstrative.</p>

<p>Things seemed black indeed, and the Captains' wives peered
under<br>
 their eyebrows at the Senior Subaltern, and the Colonel's face
set<br>
 like the Day of Judgment framed in gray bristles, and no one
spoke<br>
 for a while.</p>

<p>Next the Colonel said, very shortly:--"Well, Sir?" and the
woman<br>
 sobbed afresh. The Senior Subaltern was half choked with the
arms<br>
 round his neck, but he gasped out:--"It's a d----d lie! I
never<br>
 had a wife in my life!" "Don't swear," said the Colonel.
"Come<br>
 into the Mess. We must sift this clear somehow," and he sighed
to<br>
 himself, for he believed in his "Shikarris," did the
Colonel.</p>

<p>We trooped into the ante-room, under the full lights, and
there we<br>
 saw how beautiful the woman was. She stood up in the middle of
us<br>
 all, sometimes choking with crying, then hard and proud, and
then<br>
 holding out her arms to the Senior Subaltern. It was like
the<br>
 fourth act of a tragedy. She told us how the Senior Subaltern
had<br>
 married her when he was Home on leave eighteen months before;
and<br>
 she seemed to know all that we knew, and more too, of his
people<br>
 and his past life. He was white and ashy gray, trying now
and<br>
 again to break into the torrent of her words; and we, noting
how<br>
 lovely she was and what a criminal he looked, esteemed him a
beast<br>
 of the worst kind. We felt sorry for him, though.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the indictment of the Senior Subaltern by
his<br>
 wife. Nor will he. It was so sudden, rushing out of the
dark,<br>
 unannounced, into our dull lives. The Captains' wives stood
back;<br>
 but their eyes were alight, and you could see that they had
already<br>
 convicted and sentenced the Senior Subaltern. The Colonel
seemed<br>
 five years older. One Major was shading his eyes with his hand
and<br>
 watching the woman from underneath it. Another was chewing
his<br>
 moustache and smiling quietly as if he were witnessing a
play.<br>
 Full in the open space in the centre, by the whist-tables,
the<br>
 Senior Subaltern's terrier was hunting for fleas. I remember
all<br>
 this as clearly as though a photograph were in my hand. I
remember<br>
 the look of horror on the Senior Subaltern's face. It was
rather<br>
 like seeing a man hanged; but much more interesting. Finally,
the<br>
 woman wound up by saying that the Senior Subaltern carried a
double<br>
 F. M. in tattoo on his left shoulder. We all knew that, and to
our<br>
 innocent minds it seemed to clinch the matter. But one of
the<br>
 Bachelor Majors said very politely:--"I presume that your
marriage<br>
 certificate would be more to the purpose?"</p>

<p>That roused the woman. She stood up and sneered at the
Senior<br>
 Subaltern for a cur, and abused the Major and the Colonel and
all<br>
 the rest. Then she wept, and then she pulled a paper from
her<br>
 breast, saying imperially:--"Take that! And let my
husband--my<br>
 lawfully wedded husband--read it aloud--if he dare!"</p>

<p>There was a hush, and the men looked into each other's eyes as
the<br>
 Senior Subaltern came forward in a dazed and dizzy way, and
took<br>
 the paper. We were wondering as we stared, whether there was<br>
 anything against any one of us that might turn up later on.
The<br>
 Senior Subaltern's throat was dry; but, as he ran his eye over
the<br>
 paper, he broke out into a hoarse cackle of relief, and said to
the<br>
 woman:--"You young blackguard!"</p>

<p>But the woman had fled through a door, and on the paper
was<br>
 written:--"This is to certify that I, The Worm, have paid in
full<br>
 my debts to the Senior Subaltern, and, further, that the
Senior<br>
 Subaltern is my debtor, by agreement on the 23d of February, as
by<br>
 the Mess attested, to the extent of one month's Captain's pay,
in<br>
 the lawful currency of the India Empire."</p>

<p>Then a deputation set off for The Worm's quarters and found
him,<br>
 betwixt and between, unlacing his stays, with the hat, wig,
serge<br>
 dress, etc., on the bed. He came over as he was, and the<br>
 "Shikarris" shouted till the Gunners' Mess sent over to know
if<br>
 they might have a share of the fun. I think we were all,
except<br>
 the Colonel and the Senior Subaltern, a little disappointed
that<br>
 the scandal had come to nothing. But that is human nature.
There<br>
 could be no two words about The Worm's acting. It leaned as
near<br>
 to a nasty tragedy as anything this side of a joke can. When
most<br>
 of the Subalterns sat upon him with sofa-cushions to find out
why<br>
 he had not said that acting was his strong point, he answered
very<br>
 quietly:--"I don't think you ever asked me. I used to act at
Home<br>
 with my sisters." But no acting with girls could account for
The<br>
 Worm's display that night. Personally, I think it was in bad<br>
 taste. Besides being dangerous. There is no sort of use in
playing<br>
 with fire, even for fun.</p>

<p>The "Shikarris" made him President of the Regimental Dramatic
Club;<br>
 and, when the Senior Subaltern paid up his debt, which he did
at<br>
 once, The Worm sank the money in scenery and dresses. He was
a<br>
 good Worm; and the "Shikarris" are proud of him. The only
drawback<br>
 is that he has been christened "Mrs. Senior Subaltern;" and
as<br>
 there are now two Mrs. Senior Subalterns in the Station, this
is<br>
 sometimes confusing to strangers.</p>

<p>Later on, I will tell you of a case something like, this, but
with<br>
 all the jest left out and nothing in it but real trouble.</p>

 "My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side

 working through generations, and leading to the most outre

 it would make all fiction, with its conventionalities and
foreseen<br>
 conclusions, most stale and unprofitable."</p>

<p><br>
 "And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases
which<br>
 come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and
vulgar<br>
 enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its<br>
 extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,<br>
 neither fascinating nor artistic."</p>

<p>"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing
a<br>
 realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the
police<br>
 report, where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes
of<br>
 the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer
contain<br>
 the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there
is<br>
 nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."</p>

<p>I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your
thinking<br>
 so," I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial
adviser<br>
 and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout
three<br>
 continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange
and<br>
 bizarre. But here,"--I picked up the morning paper from the<br>
 ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the
first<br>
 heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his
wife.'<br>
 There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it
that<br>
 it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the
other<br>
 woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the
unsympathetic<br>
 sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent
nothing<br>
 more crude."</p>

<p>"Indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,"
said<br>
 Holmes, taking the paper, and glancing his eye down it. "This
is<br>
 the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged
in<br>
 clearing up some small points in connection with it. The
husband<br>
 was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct<br>
 complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding
up<br>
 every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at
his<br>
 wife, which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to
the<br>
 imagination of the average story teller. Take a pinch of
snuff,<br>
 doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your<br>
 example."</p>

<p>He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in
the<br>
 center of the lid. Its splendor was in such contrast to his
homely<br>
 ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon
it.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some
weeks.<br>
 It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia, in return for
my<br>
 assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."</p>

<p>"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant
which<br>
 sparkled upon his finger.</p>

<p>"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter
in<br>
 which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide
it<br>
 even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two
of<br>
 my little problems."</p>

<p>"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with
interest.</p>

<p>"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any features
of<br>
 interest. They are important, you understand, without being<br>
 interesting. Indeed I have found that it is usually in
unimportant<br>
 matters that there is a field for the observation, and for
the<br>
 quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to
an<br>
 investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler,
for<br>
 the bigger the crime, the more obvious, as a rule, is the
motive.<br>
 In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has
been<br>
 referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents
any<br>
 features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may
have<br>
 something better before very many minutes are over, for this is
one<br>
 of my clients, or I am much mistaken."</p>

<p>He had risen from his chair, and was standing between the
parted<br>
 blinds, gazing down into the dull, neutral-tinted London
street.<br>
 Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement
opposite<br>
 there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,
and<br>
 a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was
tilted<br>
 in a coquettish Duchess-of-Devonshire fashion over her ear.</p>

<p>From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,<br>
 hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated<br>
 backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her
glove<br>
 buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves
the<br>
 bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang
of<br>
 the bell.</p>

<p>"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing
his<br>
 cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement
always<br>
 means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not
sure<br>
 that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And
yet<br>
 even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been
seriously<br>
 wronged by a man, she no longer oscillates, and the usual
symptom<br>
 is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a
love<br>
 matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed
or<br>
 grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our
doubts."</p>

<p>As he spoke, there was a tap at the door, and the boy in
buttons<br>
 entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady
herself<br>
 loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed
merchantman<br>
 behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with
the<br>
 easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and having closed
the<br>
 door, and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in
the<br>
 minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.</p>

<p>"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is
a<br>
 little trying to do so much typewriting?"</p>

<p>"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the
letters<br>
 are without looking." Then, suddenly realizing the full purport
of<br>
 his words, she gave a violent start, and looked up with fear
and<br>
 astonishment upon her broad, good-humored face. "You've
heard<br>
 about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know
all<br>
 that?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing, "it is my business to
know<br>
 things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others
overlook.<br>
 If not, why should you come to consult me?"</p>

<p>"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs.
Etherege,<br>
 whose husband you found so easily when the police and everyone
had<br>
 given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as
much<br>
 for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my
own<br>
 right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I
would<br>
 give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."</p>

<p>"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?"
asked<br>
 Sherlock Holmes, with his finger tips together, and his eyes to
the<br>
 ceiling.</p>

<p>Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of
Miss<br>
 Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she
said,<br>
 "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.
Windibank--<br>
 that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the
police,<br>
 and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do
nothing,<br>
 and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad,
and<br>
 I just on with my things and came right away to you."</p>

<p>"Your father?" said Holmes. "Your stepfather, surely, since
the<br>
 name is different."</p>

<p>"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds
funny,<br>
 too, for he is only five years and two months older than
myself."</p>

<p>"And your mother is alive?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased,
Mr.<br>
 Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and
a<br>
 man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father
was<br>
 a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy
business<br>
 behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the
foreman;<br>
 but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for
he<br>
 was very superior, being a traveler in wines. They got four<br>
 thousand seven hundred for the good-will and interest, which
wasn't<br>
 near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."</p>

<p>I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this
rambling<br>
 and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had<br>
 listened with the greatest concentration of attention.</p>

<p>"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of
the<br>
 business?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate, and was left me by my
Uncle<br>
 Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying four and
half<br>
 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but
I<br>
 can only touch the interest."</p>

<p>"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw
so<br>
 large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the<br>
 bargain, you no doubt travel a little, and indulge yourself
in<br>
 every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very
nicely<br>
 upon an income of about sixty pounds."</p>

<p>"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you<br>
 understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be
a<br>
 burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while
I<br>
 am staying with them. Of course that is only just for the
time.<br>
 Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter, and pays it over
to<br>
 mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn
at<br>
 typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often
do<br>
 from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."</p>

<p>"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.
"This<br>
 is my friend, Doctor Watson, before whom you can speak as freely
as<br>
 before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection
with<br>
 Mr. Hosmer Angel."</p>

<p>A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked
nervously<br>
 at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the
gasfitters'<br>
 ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he
was<br>
 alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them
to<br>
 mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish
us<br>
 to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as
to<br>
 join a Sunday School treat. But this time I was set on going,
and<br>
 I would go, for what right had he to prevent? He said the
folk<br>
 were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to
be<br>
 there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had
my<br>
 purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the
drawer.<br>
 At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon
the<br>
 business of the firm; but we went, mother and I, with Mr.
Hardy,<br>
 who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.
Hosmer<br>
 Angel."</p>

<p><br>
 "I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back
from<br>
 France, he was very annoyed at your having gone to the
ball?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember,
and<br>
 shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying
anything<br>
 to a woman, for she would have her way."</p>

<p>"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand,
a<br>
 gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask
if<br>
 we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is
to<br>
 say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that
father<br>
 came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the
house<br>
 any more."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know, father didn't like anything of the sort.
He<br>
 wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to
say<br>
 that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But
then,<br>
 as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to
begin<br>
 with, and I had not got mine yet."</p>

<p>"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to
see<br>
 you?"</p>

<p>"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and
Hosmer<br>
 wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see
each<br>
 other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and
he<br>
 used to write every day. I took the letters in the morning,
so<br>
 there was no need for father to know."</p>

<p>"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk
that we<br>
 took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in
Leadenhall<br>
 Street--and--"</p>

<p>"What office?"</p>

<p>"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes; I don't know."</p>

<p>"Where did he live, then?"</p>

<p>"He slept on the premises."</p>

<p>"And you don't know his address?"</p>

<p>"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."</p>

<p>"Where did you address your letters, then?"</p>

<p>"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called
for.<br>
 He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed
by<br>
 all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I
offered<br>
 to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that,
for<br>
 he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me,
but<br>
 when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had
come<br>
 between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me,
Mr.<br>
 Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."</p>

<p>"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an
axiom<br>
 of mine that the little things are infinitely the most
important.<br>
 Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer
Angel?"</p>

<p>"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with
me<br>
 in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated
to<br>
 be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even
his<br>
 voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when
he<br>
 was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat
and a<br>
 hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well<br>
 dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as
mine<br>
 are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."</p>

<p>"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your
stepfather,<br>
 returned to France?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again, and proposed that
we<br>
 should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful
earnest,<br>
 and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that
whatever<br>
 happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was
quite<br>
 right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his
passion.<br>
 Mother was all in his favor from the first, and was even fonder
of<br>
 him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within
the<br>
 week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to
mind<br>
 about father, but just to tell him afterwards and mother said
she<br>
 would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that,
Mr.<br>
 Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he
was<br>
 only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything
on<br>
 the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company
has<br>
 its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the
very<br>
 morning of the wedding."</p>

<p>"It missed him, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, for he had started to England just before it
arrived."</p>

<p>"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then,
for<br>
 the Friday. Was it to be in church?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's,
near<br>
 King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the
St.<br>
 Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there
were<br>
 two of us, he put us both into it, and stepped himself into a
four-<br>
 wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street.
We<br>
 got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up
we<br>
 waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the
cabman<br>
 got down from the box and looked, there was no one there!
The<br>
 cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him,
for<br>
 he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last
Friday,<br>
 Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then
to<br>
 throw any light upon what became of him."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,"
said<br>
 Holmes.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why,
all<br>
 the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was
to<br>
 be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred
to<br>
 separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to
him,<br>
 and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It
seemed<br>
 strange talk for a wedding morning, but what has happened
since<br>
 gives a meaning to it."</p>

<p>"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that
some<br>
 unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he
would<br>
 not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw<br>
 happened."</p>

<p>"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"</p>

<p>"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the
matter<br>
 again."</p>

<p>"And your father? Did you tell him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he seemed to think, with me, that something had
happened,<br>
 and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what
interest<br>
 could anyone have in bringing me to the door of the church,
and<br>
 then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he
had<br>
 married me and got my money settled on him, there might be
some<br>
 reason; but Hosmer was very independent about money, and
never<br>
 would look at a shilling of mine. And yet what could have<br>
 happened? And why could he not write? Oh! it drives me half
mad<br>
 to think of, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled
a<br>
 little handkerchief out of her muff, and began to sob heavily
into<br>
 it.</p>

<p>"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising,
"and I<br>
 have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let
the<br>
 weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your
mind<br>
 dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer
Angel<br>
 vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"</p>

<p>"I fear not."</p>

<p>"Then what has happened to him?"</p>

<p>"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like
an<br>
 accurate description of him, and any letters of his which you
can<br>
 spare."</p>

<p>"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said
she.<br>
 "Here is the slip, and here are four letters from him."</p>

<p>"Thank you. And your address?"</p>

<p>"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."</p>

<p>"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is
your<br>
 father's place of business?"</p>

<p>"He travels for Westhouse &amp; Marbank, the great claret
importers of<br>
 Fenchurch Street."</p>

<p>"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You
will<br>
 leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have
given<br>
 you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow
it<br>
 to affect your life."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall
be<br>
 true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."</p>

<p>For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there
was<br>
 something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which
compelled<br>
 our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the
table,<br>
 and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she
might<br>
 be summoned.</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his finger
tips<br>
 still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,
and<br>
 his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down
from<br>
 the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a<br>
 counselor, and, having lighted it, he leaned back in his
chair,<br>
 with thick blue cloud wreaths spinning up from him, and a look
of<br>
 infinite languor in his face.</p>

<p>"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I
found<br>
 her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,
is<br>
 rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you
consult<br>
 my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort
at<br>
 The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were
one<br>
 or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself
was<br>
 most instructive."</p>

<p>"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite<br>
 invisible to me," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Not invisible, but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where
to<br>
 look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never
bring<br>
 you to realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness
of<br>
 thumb nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot
lace.<br>
 Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance?
Describe<br>
 it."</p>

<p>"Well, she had a slate-colored, broad-brimmed straw hat, with
a<br>
 feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black
beads<br>
 sewed upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments.
Her<br>
 dress was brown, rather darker than coffee color, with a
little<br>
 purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were grayish,
and<br>
 were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I
didn't<br>
 observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a
general<br>
 air of being fairly well-to-do, in a vulgar, comfortable,
easygoing<br>
 way."</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and
chuckled.</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You
have<br>
 really done very well indeed. It is true that you have
missed<br>
 everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and
you<br>
 have a quick eye for color. Never trust to general impressions,
my<br>
 boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance
is<br>
 always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first
to<br>
 take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had
plush<br>
 upon her sleeve, which is a most useful material for showing<br>
 traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the<br>
 typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully
defined.<br>
 The sewing machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark,
but<br>
 only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from
the<br>
 thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as
this<br>
 was. I then glanced at her face, and observing the dint of a<br>
 pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark
upon<br>
 short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."</p>

<p>"It surprised me."</p>

<p>"But, surely, it was very obvious. I was then much surprised
and<br>
 interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots
which<br>
 she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really
odd<br>
 ones, the one having a slightly decorated toe cap and the other
a<br>
 plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out
of<br>
 five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when
you<br>
 see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away
from<br>
 home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to
say<br>
 that she came away in a hurry."</p>

<p><br>
 "And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by
my<br>
 friend's incisive reasoning.</p>

<p>"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before
leaving<br>
 home, but after being fully dressed. You observed that her
right<br>
 glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not, apparently,
see<br>
 that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She
had<br>
 written in a hurry, and dipped her pen too deep. It must have
been<br>
 this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the
finger.<br>
 All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go
back<br>
 to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the
advertised<br>
 description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"</p>

<p>I held the little printed slip to the light. "Missing," it
said,<br>
 "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer
Angel.<br>
 About five feet seven inches in height; strongly built,
sallow<br>
 complexion, black hair, a little bald in the center, bushy
black<br>
 side-whiskers and mustache; tinted glasses; slight infirmity
of<br>
 speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat
faced<br>
 with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and gray
Harris<br>
 tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots.
Known<br>
 to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street.
Anybody<br>
 bringing," etc., etc.</p>

<p>"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he
continued,<br>
 glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no
clew<br>
 in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There
is<br>
 one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike
you."</p>

<p>"They are typewritten," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the
neat<br>
 little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see,
but<br>
 no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather
vague.<br>
 The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we
may<br>
 call it conclusive."</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly
it<br>
 bears upon the case?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I do, unless it were that he wished to be
able<br>
 to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise
were<br>
 instituted."</p>

<p>"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two
letters<br>
 which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City,
the<br>
 other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking
him<br>
 whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening.
It<br>
 is just as well that we should do business with the male
relatives.<br>
 And now, doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to
those<br>
 letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf
for<br>
 the interim."</p>

<p>I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle
powers<br>
 of reasoning, and extraordinary energy in action, that I felt
that<br>
 he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy
demeanor<br>
 with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been
called<br>
 upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case
of<br>
 the King of Bohemia and the Irene Adler photograph, but when
I<br>
 looked back to the weird business of the "Sign of the Four,"
and<br>
 the extraordinary circumstances connected with the "Study in<br>
 Scarlet," I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which
he<br>
 could not unravel.</p>

<p>I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with
the<br>
 conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would
find<br>
 that he held in his hands all the clews which would lead up to
the<br>
 identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary
Sutherland.</p>

<p>A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own
attention<br>
 at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside
of<br>
 the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I
found<br>
 myself free, and was able to spring into a hansom and drive
to<br>
 Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at
the<br>
 denouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes
alone,<br>
 however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in
the<br>
 recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and
test-<br>
 tubes, with the pungent, cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid,
told<br>
 me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so
dear<br>
 to him.</p>

<p>"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.</p>

<p>"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."</p>

<p>"No, no; the mystery!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working
upon.<br>
 There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said<br>
 yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only
drawback<br>
 is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the
scoundrel."</p>

<p>"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting
Miss<br>
 Sutherland?"</p>

<p>The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not
yet<br>
 opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in
the<br>
 passage, and a tap at the door.</p>

<p>"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said
Holmes.<br>
 "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six.
Come<br>
 in!"</p>

<p>The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some
thirty<br>
 years of age, clean shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a
bland,<br>
 insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and
penetrating<br>
 gray eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed
his<br>
 shiny top hat upon the sideboard, and, with a slight bow,
sidled<br>
 down into the nearest chair.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think
this<br>
 typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an
appointment<br>
 with me for six o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not
quite<br>
 my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has<br>
 troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far
better<br>
 not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against
my<br>
 wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive
girl,<br>
 as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when
she<br>
 has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you
so<br>
 much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it
is<br>
 not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised
abroad.<br>
 Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly
find<br>
 this Hosmer Angel?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Holmes, quietly, "I have every reason
to<br>
 believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer
Angel."</p>

<p>Mr. Windibank gave a violent start, and dropped his gloves. "I
am<br>
 delighted to hear it," he said.</p>

<p>"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter
has<br>
 really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting.
Unless<br>
 they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike. Some<br>
 letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one
side.<br>
 Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in
every<br>
 case there is some little slurring over the e, and a slight
defect<br>
 in the tail of the r. There are fourteen other
characteristics,<br>
 but those are the more obvious."</p>

<p>"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,
and<br>
 no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered,
glancing<br>
 keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.</p>

<p>"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting
study,<br>
 Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing
another<br>
 little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and
its<br>
 relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted
some<br>
 little attention. I have here four letters which purport to
come<br>
 from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case,
not<br>
 only are the e's slurred and the r's tailless, but you will<br>
 observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the
fourteen<br>
 other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as
well."</p>

<p>Mr. Windibank sprung out of his chair, and picked up his hat.
"I<br>
 cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"
he<br>
 said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know
when<br>
 you have done it."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in
the<br>
 door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"</p>

<p>"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his
lips,<br>
 and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.</p>

<p>"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes, suavely.
"There<br>
 is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite
too<br>
 transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that
it<br>
 was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's
right!<br>
 Sit down, and let us talk it over."</p>

<p>Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face, and
a<br>
 glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable,"
he<br>
 stammered.</p>

<p>"I am very much afraid that it is not; but between
ourselves,<br>
 Windibank, it was as cruel, and selfish, and heartless a trick
in a<br>
 petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over
the<br>
 course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."</p>

<p>The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon
his<br>
 breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet
up<br>
 on the corner of the mantelpiece, and, leaning back with his
hands<br>
 in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it
seemed,<br>
 than to us.</p>

<p>"The man married a woman very much older than himself for
her<br>
 money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the<br>
 daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a
considerable<br>
 sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would
have<br>
 made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve
it.<br>
 The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but
affectionate<br>
 and warmhearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with
her<br>
 fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not
be<br>
 allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean,
of<br>
 course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her
stepfather<br>
 do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her
at<br>
 home, and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her
own<br>
 age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever.
She<br>
 became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced
her<br>
 positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her<br>
 clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable
to<br>
 his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance
of<br>
 his wife, he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with
tinted<br>
 glasses, masked the face with a mustache and a pair of bushy<br>
 whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper,
and<br>
 doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears
as<br>
 Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love<br>
 himself."</p>

<p>"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We
never<br>
 thought that she would have been so carried away."</p>

<p>"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was
very<br>
 decidedly carried away, and having quite made up her mind that
her<br>
 stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for
an<br>
 instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the
gentleman's<br>
 attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly
expressed<br>
 admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it
was<br>
 obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as if would go,
if<br>
 a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and
an<br>
 engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections
from<br>
 turning toward anyone else. But the deception could not be kept
up<br>
 forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather
cumbrous.<br>
 The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in
such<br>
 a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression
upon<br>
 the young lady's mind, and prevent her from looking upon any
other<br>
 suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity
exacted<br>
 upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility
of<br>
 something happening on the very morning of the wedding.
James<br>
 Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer
Angel,<br>
 and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at
any<br>
 rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the
church<br>
 door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he<br>
 conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at
one<br>
 door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that that
was<br>
 the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"</p>

<br>
Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while
Holmes<br>
had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold
sneer<br>
upon his pale face.

<p>"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he; "but if
you are<br>
 so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is
you<br>
 who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done
nothing<br>
 actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door
locked<br>
 you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal<br>
 constraint."</p>

<p>"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes,
unlocking and<br>
 throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who
deserved<br>
 punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend,
he<br>
 ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he
continued,<br>
 flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's
face,<br>
 "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a
hunting<br>
 crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--" He
took<br>
 two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there
was<br>
 a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door<br>
 banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank<br>
 running at the top of his speed down the road.</p>

<p>"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing as
he<br>
 threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow
will<br>
 rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and
ends<br>
 on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not
entirely<br>
 devoid of interest."</p>

<p>"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,"
I<br>
 remarked.</p>

<p>"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.
Hosmer<br>
 Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and
it<br>
 was equally clear that the only man who really profited by
the<br>
 incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then
the<br>
 fact that the two men were never together, but that the one
always<br>
 appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were
the<br>
 tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at
a<br>
 disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all<br>
 confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his
signature,<br>
 which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar
to<br>
 her that she would recognize even the smallest sample of it.
You<br>
 see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,
all<br>
 pointed in the same direction."</p>

<p>"And how did you verify them?"</p>

<p>"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration.
I<br>
 knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the
printed<br>
 description, I eliminated everything from it which could be
the<br>
 result of a disguise,--the whiskers, the glasses, the
voice,--and I<br>
 sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me<br>
 whether it answered to the description of any of their
travelers.<br>
 I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and
I<br>
 wrote to the man himself at his business address, asking him if
he<br>
 would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten,
and<br>
 revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The
same<br>
 post brought me a letter from Westhouse &amp; Marbank, of
Fenchurch<br>
 Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect
with<br>
 that of their employee, James Windibank. Voila tout!"</p>

<p>"And Miss Sutherland?"</p>

<p>"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the
old<br>
 Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger
cub,<br>
 and danger also for whoso snatcheth a delusion from a
woman.'<br>
 There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much
knowledge<br>
 of the world."</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>A Scandal in Bohemia</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><br>
 To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom
heard<br>
 him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
and<br>
 predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
any<br>
 emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that
one<br>
 particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
admirably<br>
 balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning
and<br>
 observing machine that the world has seen; but as a lover, he
would<br>
 have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of
the<br>
 softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were
admirable<br>
 things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from
men's<br>
 motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit
such<br>
 intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted
temperament<br>
 was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a
doubt<br>
 upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or
a<br>
 crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more<br>
 disturbing that a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
yet<br>
 there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late
Irene<br>
 Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.</p>

<p><br>
 I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted
us<br>
 away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
home-<br>
 centered interests which rise up around the man who first
finds<br>
 himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to
absorb<br>
 all my attention; while Holmes, who loathed every form of
society<br>
 with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in
Baker<br>
 Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week
to<br>
 week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug
and<br>
 the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as
ever,<br>
 deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his
immense<br>
 faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following
out<br>
 those clews, and clearing up those mysteries, which had been<br>
 abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time
I<br>
 heard some vague account of his doings; of his summons to Odessa
in<br>
 the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the
singular<br>
 tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of
the<br>
 mission which he had accomplished so delicately and
successfully<br>
 for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of
his<br>
 activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers
of<br>
 the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and
companion.</p>

<p>One night--it was on the 20th of March, 1888--I was returning
from<br>
 a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil
practice),<br>
 when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the
well-<br>
 remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with
my<br>
 wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I
was<br>
 seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how
he<br>
 was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were
brilliantly<br>
 lighted, and even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure
pass<br>
 twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing
the<br>
 room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest, and
his<br>
 hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and<br>
 habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was
at<br>
 work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams, and
was<br>
 hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell, and
was<br>
 shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my
own.</p>

<p>His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad,
I<br>
 think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a
kindly<br>
 eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of
cigars,<br>
 and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then
he<br>
 stood before the fire, and looked me over in his singular<br>
 introspective fashion.</p>

<p>"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you
have<br>
 put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."</p>

<p>"Seven," I answered.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle
more,<br>
 I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did
not<br>
 tell me that you intended to go into harness."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know?"</p>

<p>"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been
getting<br>
 yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy
and<br>
 careless servant girl?"</p>

<p>"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would
certainly<br>
 have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago. It is
true<br>
 that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a
dreadful<br>
 mess; but as I have changed my clothes, I can't imagine how
you<br>
 deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife
has<br>
 given her notice; but there again I fail to see how you work
it<br>
 out."</p>

<p>He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands
together.</p>

<p>"It is simplicity itself," said he, "my eyes tell me that on
the<br>
 inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,
the<br>
 leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they
have<br>
 been caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round
the<br>
 edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
Hence,<br>
 you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile
weather,<br>
 and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slicking specimen
of<br>
 the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks
into<br>
 my rooms, smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate
of<br>
 silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the side of
his<br>
 top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must
be<br>
 dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of
the<br>
 medical profession."</p>

<p>I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained
his<br>
 process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I<br>
 remarked, "the thing always appears to me so ridiculously
simple<br>
 that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive<br>
 instance of your reasoning I am baffled, until you explain
your<br>
 process. And yet, I believe that my eyes are as good as
yours."</p>

<p>"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing
himself<br>
 down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The<br>
 distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen
the<br>
 steps which lead up from the hall to this room."</p>

<p>"Frequently."</p>

<p>"How often?"</p>

<p>"Well, some hundreds of times."</p>

<p>"Then how many are there?"</p>

<p>"How many? I don't know."</p>

<p>"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That
is<br>
 just my point. Now, I know there are seventeen steps, because
I<br>
 have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are
interested<br>
 in these little problems, and since you are good enough to<br>
 chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be<br>
 interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick
pink-tinted<br>
 note paper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came
by<br>
 the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."</p>

<p>The note was undated, and without either signature or
address.</p>

<p>"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight
o'clock,"<br>
 it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter
of<br>
 the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the
royal<br>
 houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely
be<br>
 trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly
be<br>
 exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters<br>
 received. Be in your chamber, then, at that hour, and do not
take<br>
 it amiss if your visitor wears a mask."</p>

<p>"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine
that<br>
 it means?"</p>

<p>"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize
before<br>
 one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit<br>
 theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note
itself--<br>
 what do you deduce from it?"</p>

<p>I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it
was<br>
 written.</p>

<p>"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I
remarked,<br>
 endeavoring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper
could<br>
 not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly
strong<br>
 and stiff."</p>

<p>"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not
an<br>
 English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."</p>

<p>I did so, and saw a large E with a small g, a P and a large G
with<br>
 a small t woven into the texture of the paper.</p>

<p>"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.</p>

<p>"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram,
rather."</p>

<p>"Not all. The G with the small t stands for 'Gesellschaft,'
which<br>
 is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction
like<br>
 our 'Co.' P, of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the Eg.
Let<br>
 us glance at our 'Continental Gazetteer." He took down a
heavy<br>
 brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we
are,<br>
 Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not
far<br>
 from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death
of<br>
 Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass factories and paper
mills.'<br>
 Ha! ha! my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled,
and<br>
 he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.</p>

<p>"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.</p>

<p>"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do
you<br>
 note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account
of<br>
 you we have from all quarters received'? A Frenchman or
Russian<br>
 could not have written that. It is the German who is so<br>
 uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to
discover<br>
 what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper,
and<br>
 prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes,
if<br>
 I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."</p>

<p>As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and
grating<br>
 wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the
bell.<br>
 Holmes whistled.</p>

<p>"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing
out<br>
 of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties.
A<br>
 hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this
case,<br>
 Watson, if there is nothing else."</p>

<p>"I think I had better go, Holmes."</p>

<p>"Not a bit, doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without
my<br>
 Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a
pity<br>
 to miss it."</p>

<p>"But your client--"</p>

<p>"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here
he<br>
 comes. Sit down in that armchair, doctor, and give us your
best<br>
 attention."</p>

<p>A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs
and in<br>
 the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was
a<br>
 loud and authoritative tap.</p>

<p>"Come in!" said Holmes.</p>

<p>A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet
six<br>
 inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules.
His<br>
 dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be
looked<br>
 upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were
slashed<br>
 across the sleeves and front of his double-breasted coat, while
the<br>
 deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined
with<br>
 flame-colored silk, and secured at the neck with a brooch
which<br>
 consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended
halfway<br>
 up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich
brown<br>
 fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was<br>
 suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed
hat<br>
 in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his
face,<br>
 extending down past the cheek-bones, a black visard mask, which
he<br>
 had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was
still<br>
 raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face
he<br>
 appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick,
hanging<br>
 lip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed
to<br>
 the length of obstinacy.</p>

<p>"You had my note?" he asked, with a deep, harsh voice and
a<br>
 strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call."
He<br>
 looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to<br>
 address.</p>

<p><br>
 "Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and
colleague,<br>
 Doctor Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in
my<br>
 cases. Whom have I the honor to address?"</p>

<p>"You may address me as the Count von Kramm, a Bohemian
nobleman. I<br>
 understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honor
and<br>
 discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most
extreme<br>
 importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with
you<br>
 alone."</p>

<p>I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me
back<br>
 into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say<br>
 before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."</p>

<p>The count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin,"
said<br>
 he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at
the<br>
 end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At
present<br>
 it is not too much to say that it is of such weight that it
may<br>
 have an influence upon European history."</p>

<p>"I promise," said Holmes.</p>

<p>"And I."</p>

<p>"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor.
"The<br>
 august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to
you,<br>
 and I may confess at once that the title by which I have
just<br>
 called myself is not exactly my own."</p>

<p>"I was aware of it," said Holmes, dryly.</p>

<p>"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution
has<br>
 to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal,
and<br>
 seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe.
To<br>
 speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of
Ormstein,<br>
 hereditary kings of Bohemia."</p>

<p>"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself
down<br>
 in his armchair, and closing his eyes.</p>

<p>Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the
languid,<br>
 lounging figure of the man who had been, no doubt, depicted to
him<br>
 as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in
Europe.<br>
 Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at
his<br>
 gigantic client.</p>

<p>"If your majesty would condescend to state your case," he
remarked,<br>
 "I should be better able to advise you."</p>

<p>The man sprung from his chair, and paced up and down the room
in<br>
 uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation,
he<br>
 tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.</p>

<p>"You are right," he cried, "I am the king. Why should I
attempt to<br>
 conceal it?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your majesty had not
spoken<br>
 before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich<br>
 Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and<br>
 hereditary King of Bohemia."</p>

<p>"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting
down<br>
 once more and passing his hand over his high, white forehead,
"you<br>
 can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business
in<br>
 my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could
not<br>
 confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I
have<br>
 come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting
you."</p>

<p>"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once
more.</p>

<p>"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a
lengthy<br>
 visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known<br>
 adventuress Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to
you."</p>

<p>"Kindly look her up in my index, doctor," murmured Holmes,
without<br>
 opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system for<br>
 docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it
was<br>
 difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not
at<br>
 once furnish information. In this case I found her biography<br>
 sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a
staff<br>
 commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea
fishes.</p>

<p>"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the
year<br>
 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala--hum! Prima donna Imperial
Opera<br>
 of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in<br>
 London--quite so! Your majesty, as I understand, became
entangled<br>
 with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and
is<br>
 now desirous of getting those letters back."</p>

<p>"Precisely so. But how--"</p>

<p>"Was there a secret marriage?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"No legal papers or certificates?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Then I fail to follow your majesty. If this young person
should<br>
 produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is
she<br>
 to prove their authenticity?"</p>

<p>"There is the writing."</p>

<p>"Pooh-pooh! Forgery."</p>

<p>"My private note paper."</p>

<p>"Stolen."</p>

<p>"My own seal."</p>

<p>"Imitated."</p>

<p>"My photograph."</p>

<p>"Bought."</p>

<p>"We were both in the photograph."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! That is very bad. Your majesty has indeed committed
an<br>
 indiscretion."</p>

<p>"I was mad--insane."</p>

<p>"You have compromised yourself seriously."</p>

<p>"I was only crown prince then. I was young. I am but thirty
now."</p>

<p>"It must be recovered."</p>

<p>"We have tried and failed."</p>

<p>"Your majesty must pay. It must be bought."</p>

<p>"She will not sell."</p>

<p>"Stolen, then."</p>

<p>"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay
ransacked<br>
 her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she traveled.
Twice<br>
 she has been waylaid. There has been no result."</p>

<p>"No sign of it?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely none."</p>

<p>Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said
he.</p>

<p>"But a very serious one to me," returned the king,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the<br>
 photograph?"</p>

<p>"To ruin me."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"I am about to be married."</p>

<p>"So I have heard."</p>

<p>"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, second daughter of
the<br>
 King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of
her<br>
 family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of
a<br>
 doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."</p>

<p>"And Irene Adler?"</p>

<p>"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it.
I<br>
 know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a
soul<br>
 of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women and
the<br>
 mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry<br>
 another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not
go--<br>
 none."</p>

<p>"You are sure she has not sent it yet?"</p>

<p>"I am sure."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when
the<br>
 betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next
Monday."</p>

<p>"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes, with a yawn.
"That<br>
 is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance
to<br>
 look into just at present. Your majesty will, of course, stay
in<br>
 London for the present?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham, under the name of
the<br>
 Count von Kramm."</p>

<p>"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we
progress."</p>

<p>"Pray do so; I shall be all anxiety."</p>

<p>"Then, as to money?"</p>

<p>"You have carte blanche."</p>

<p>"Absolutely?"</p>

<p>"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my
kingdom to<br>
 have that photograph."</p>

<p>"And for present expenses?"</p>

<p>The king took a heavy chamois-leather bag from under his
cloak, and<br>
 laid it on the table.</p>

<p>"There are three hundred pounds in gold, and seven hundred
in<br>
 notes," he said.</p>

<p>Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook, and
handed<br>
 it to him.</p>

<p>"And mademoiselle's address?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."</p>

<p>Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he,<br>
 thoughtfully. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>"Then, good-night, your majesty, and I trust that we shall
soon<br>
 have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added,
as<br>
 the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If
you<br>
 will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three
o'clock,<br>
 I should like to chat this little matter over with you."</p>

<h3><br>
 II</h3>

<p><br>
 At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes
had<br>
 not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left
the<br>
 house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down<br>
 beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting
him,<br>
 however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in
his<br>
 inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim
and<br>
 strange features which were associated with the two crimes which
I<br>
 have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the<br>
 exalted station of his client gave it a character of its
own.<br>
 Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my
friend<br>
 had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a<br>
 situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a<br>
 pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow
the<br>
 quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most<br>
 inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his
invariable<br>
 success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased
to<br>
 enter into my head.</p>

<p><br>
 It was close upon four before the door opened, and a
drunken-<br>
 looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed
face<br>
 and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as
I<br>
 was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had
to<br>
 look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he.
With<br>
 a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in
five<br>
 minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his
hands<br>
 into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the
fire,<br>
 and laughed heartily for some minutes.</p>

<p>"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked, and laughed
again<br>
 until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the
chair.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how
I<br>
 employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching
the<br>
 habits, and, perhaps, the house, of Miss Irene Adler."</p>

<p>"Quite so, but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell
you,<br>
 however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this<br>
 morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a<br>
 wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one
of<br>
 them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon
found<br>
 Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back,
but<br>
 built out in the front right up to the road, two stories.
Chubb<br>
 lock to the door. Large sitting room on the right side, well<br>
 furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those<br>
 preposterous English window fasteners which a child could
open.<br>
 Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage
window<br>
 could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked
round<br>
 it and examined it closely from every point of view, but
without<br>
 noting anything else of interest.</p>

<p>"I then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected,
that<br>
 there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of
the<br>
 garden. I lent the hostlers a hand in rubbing down their
horses,<br>
 and I received in exchange two-pence, a glass of half and half,
two<br>
 fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could
desire<br>
 about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people
in<br>
 the neighborhood, in whom I was not in the least interested,
but<br>
 whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."</p>

<p>"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She
is<br>
 the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say
the<br>
 Serpentine Mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at
concerts,<br>
 drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for<br>
 dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she
sings.<br>
 Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is
dark,<br>
 handsome, and dashing; never calls less than once a day, and
often<br>
 twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton of the Inner Temple. See
the<br>
 advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home
a<br>
 dozen times from Serpentine Mews, and knew all about him. When
I<br>
 had listened to all that they had to tell, I began to walk up
and<br>
 down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan
of<br>
 campaign.</p>

<p>"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in
the<br>
 matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the<br>
 relation between them, and what the object of his repeated
visits?<br>
 Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the
former,<br>
 she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If
the<br>
 latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question
depended<br>
 whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn
my<br>
 attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was
a<br>
 delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I
fear<br>
 that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see
my<br>
 little difficulties, if you are to understand the
situation."</p>

<p>"I am following you closely," I answered.</p>

<p>"I was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a hansom
cab<br>
 drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprung out. He was
a<br>
 remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and
mustached--evidently<br>
 the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great
hurry,<br>
 shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who
opened<br>
 the door, with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.</p>

<p>"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch
glimpses<br>
 of him in the windows of the sitting room, pacing up and
down,<br>
 talking excitedly and waving his arms. Of her I could see
nothing.<br>
 Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before.
As<br>
 he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his
pocket<br>
 and looked at it earnestly. 'Drive like the devil!' he
shouted,<br>
 'first to Gross &amp; Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the
Church<br>
 of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it
in<br>
 twenty minutes!'</p>

<p>"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not
do<br>
 well to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little
landau,<br>
 the coachman with his coat only half buttoned, and his tie
under<br>
 his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of
the<br>
 buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall
door<br>
 and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but
she<br>
 was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.</p>

<p>"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried; 'and half a
sovereign<br>
 if you reach it in twenty minutes.'</p>

<p>"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just
balancing<br>
 whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind
her<br>
 landau, when a cab came through the street. The driver
looked<br>
 twice at such a shabby fare; but I jumped in before he could<br>
 object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a
sovereign<br>
 if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes
to<br>
 twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the
wind.</p>

<p>"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but
the<br>
 others were there before us. The cab and landau with their<br>
 steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I
paid<br>
 the man, and hurried into the church. There was not a soul
there<br>
 save the two whom I had followed, and a surpliced clergyman,
who<br>
 seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three
standing<br>
 in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle
like<br>
 any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to
my<br>
 surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and
Godfrey<br>
 Norton came running as hard as he could toward me.</p>

<p>"'Thank God!' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'</p>

<p>"'What then?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Come, man, come; only three minutes, or it won't be
legal.'</p>

<p>"I was half dragged up to the altar, and, before I knew where
I<br>
 was, I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in
my<br>
 ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and
generally<br>
 assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster,
to<br>
 Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and
there<br>
 was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on
the<br>
 other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the
most<br>
 preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life,
and<br>
 it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now.
It<br>
 seems that there had been some informality about their
license;<br>
 that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without
a<br>
 witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the<br>
 bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search
of a<br>
 best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it
on<br>
 my watch chain in memory of the occasion."</p>

<p>"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and
what<br>
 then?"</p>

<p>"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as
if<br>
 the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate
very<br>
 prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church
door,<br>
 however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she
to<br>
 her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as
usual,'<br>
 she said, as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away
in<br>
 different directions, and I went off to make my own
arrangements."</p>

<p>"Which are?"</p>

<p>"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing
the<br>
 bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely
to<br>
 be busier still this evening. By the way, doctor, I shall
want<br>
 your cooperation."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted."</p>

<p>"You don't mind breaking the law?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"Nor running a chance of arrest?"</p>

<p>"Not in a good cause."</p>

<p>"Oh, the cause is excellent!"</p>

<p>"Then I am your man."</p>

<p>"I was sure that I might rely on you."</p>

<p>"But what is it you wish?"</p>

<p>"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear
to<br>
 you. Now," he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare
that<br>
 our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for
I<br>
 have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we
must<br>
 be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather,
returns<br>
 from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet
her."</p>

<p>"And what then?"</p>

<p>"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is
to<br>
 occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You
must<br>
 not interfere, come what may. You understand?"</p>

<p>"I am to be neutral?"</p>

<p>"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small<br>
 unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being<br>
 conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the<br>
 sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself
close<br>
 to that open window."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room
what I<br>
 give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry
of<br>
 fire. You quite follow me?"</p>

<p>"Entirely."</p>

<p>"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long,
cigar-<br>
 shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's
smoke-<br>
 rocket, fitted with a cap at either end, to make it
self-lighting.<br>
 Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,
it<br>
 will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk
to<br>
 the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes.
I<br>
 hope that I have made myself clear?"</p>

<p>"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,
and,<br>
 at the signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry
of<br>
 fire and to wait you at the corner of the street."</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"Then you may entirely rely on me."</p>

<p>"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that
I<br>
 prepared for the new role I have to play."</p>

<p>He disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes
in<br>
 the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist<br>
 clergyman. His broad, black hat, his baggy trousers, his
white<br>
 tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and<br>
 benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could
have<br>
 equaled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume.
His<br>
 expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with
every<br>
 fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even
as<br>
 science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist
in<br>
 crime.</p>

<p>It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it
still<br>
 wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in<br>
 Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were
just<br>
 being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony
Lodge,<br>
 waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such
as<br>
 I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes's succinct description,
but<br>
 the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On
the<br>
 contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighborhood, it was<br>
 remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed
men<br>
 smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors grinder with
his<br>
 wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse girl,
and<br>
 several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down
with<br>
 cigars in their mouths.</p>

<p>"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of
the<br>
 house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The
photograph<br>
 becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she
would<br>
 be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton as our
client<br>
 is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question
is--<br>
 where are we to find the photograph?"</p>

<p>"Where, indeed?"</p>

<p>"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It
is<br>
 cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's<br>
 dress. She knows that the king is capable of having her
waylaid<br>
 and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made.
We<br>
 may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with
her."</p>

<p>"Where, then?"</p>

<p>"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility.
But<br>
 I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,
and<br>
 they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it
over<br>
 to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but
she<br>
 could not tell what indirect or political influence might be<br>
 brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that
she<br>
 had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she
can<br>
 lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."</p>

<p>"But it has twice been burglarized."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."</p>

<p>"But how will you look?"</p>

<p>"I will not look."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I will get her to show me."</p>

<p>"But she will refuse."</p>

<p>"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It
is<br>
 her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came
round<br>
 the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which<br>
 rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up one of
the<br>
 loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in
the<br>
 hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another
loafer<br>
 who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel
broke<br>
 out which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides
with<br>
 one of the loungers, and by the scissors grinder, who was
equally<br>
 hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant
the<br>
 lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the center of a
little<br>
 knot of struggling men who struck savagely at each other with
their<br>
 fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect
the<br>
 lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to
the<br>
 ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his
fall<br>
 the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the
loungers<br>
 in the other, while a number of better-dressed people who
had<br>
 watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to
help<br>
 the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I
will<br>
 still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the
top,<br>
 with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the
ball,<br>
 looking back into the street.</p>

<p><br>
 "Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He is dead," cried several voices.</p>

<p>"No, no, there's life in him," shouted another. "But he'll be
gone<br>
 before you can get him to the hospital."</p>

<p>"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had
the<br>
 lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were
a<br>
 gang, and a rough one, too. Ah! he's breathing now."</p>

<p>"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"</p>

<p>"Surely. Bring him into the sitting room. There is a
comfortable<br>
 sofa. This way, please." Slowly and solemnly he was borne
into<br>
 Briony Lodge, and laid out in the principal room, while I
still<br>
 observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps
had<br>
 been lighted, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I
could<br>
 see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he
was<br>
 seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was
playing,<br>
 but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in
my<br>
 life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I
was<br>
 conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
upon<br>
 the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery
to<br>
 Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to
me.<br>
 I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my<br>
 ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are
but<br>
 preventing her from injuring another.</p>

<p>Holmes had sat upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man
who<br>
 is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the
window.<br>
 At the same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal
I<br>
 tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word
was<br>
 no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators,
well<br>
 dressed and ill--gentlemen, hostlers, and servant maids--joined
in<br>
 a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled
through<br>
 the room, and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of<br>
 rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from
within<br>
 assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through
the<br>
 shouting crowd, I made my way to the corner of the street, and
in<br>
 ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and
to<br>
 get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in<br>
 silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of
the<br>
 quiet streets which led toward the Edgeware Road.</p>

<p>"You did it very nicely, doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could
have<br>
 been better. It is all right."</p>

<p>"You have the photograph?"</p>

<p>"I know where it is."</p>

<p>"And how did you find out?"</p>

<p>"She showed me, as I told you that she would."</p>

<p>"I am still in the dark."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The
matter<br>
 was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in
the<br>
 street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the
evening."</p>

<p>"I guessed as much."</p>

<p>"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint
in<br>
 the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my
hand<br>
 to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old
trick."</p>

<p>"That also I could fathom."</p>

<p>"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What
else<br>
 could she do? And into her sitting room, which was the very
room<br>
 which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I
was<br>
 determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned
for<br>
 air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had
your<br>
 chance."</p>

<p>"How did that help you?"</p>

<p>"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is
on<br>
 fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she
values<br>
 most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more
than<br>
 once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington<br>
 Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the
Arnsworth<br>
 Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby--an
unmarried<br>
 one reaches for her jewel box. Now it was clear to me that
our<br>
 lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her
than<br>
 what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The
alarm<br>
 of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough
to<br>
 shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
photograph<br>
 is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right
bell-<br>
 pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it
as<br>
 she drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm,
she<br>
 replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and
I<br>
 have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses,
escaped<br>
 from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the<br>
 photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he
was<br>
 watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little
over-<br>
 precipitance may ruin all."</p>

<p>"And now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the king
to-<br>
 morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will
be<br>
 shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady, but it is<br>
 probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the<br>
 photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain
it<br>
 with his own hands."</p>

<p>"And when will you call?"</p>

<p>"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we
shall<br>
 have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this
marriage<br>
 may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire
to<br>
 the king without delay."</p>

<p>We had reached Baker Street, and had stopped at the door. He
was<br>
 searching his pockets for the key, when some one passing
said:</p>

<p>"Good night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."</p>

<p>There were several people on the pavement at the time, but
the<br>
 greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who
had<br>
 hurried by.</p>

<p>"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the
dimly<br>
 lighted street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have<br>
 been?"</p>

<h3><br>
 III</h3>

<p><br>
 I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon
our<br>
 toast and coffee in the morning, when the King of Bohemia
rushed<br>
 into the room.</p>

<p>"You have really got it?" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes
by<br>
 either shoulder, and looking eagerly into his face.</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"But you have hopes?"</p>

<p>"I have hopes."</p>

<p>"Then come. I am all impatience to be gone."</p>

<p>"We must have a cab."</p>

<p>"No, my brougham is waiting."</p>

<p>"Then that will simplify matters." We descended, and started
off<br>
 once more for Briony Lodge.</p>

<p><br>
 "Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.</p>

<p>"Married! When?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday."</p>

<p>"But to whom?"</p>

<p>"To an English lawyer named Norton."</p>

<p>"But she could not love him."</p>

<p>"I am in hopes that she does."</p>

<p>"And why in hopes?"</p>

<p>"Because it would spare your majesty all fear of future
annoyance.<br>
 If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your majesty.
If<br>
 she does not love your majesty, there is no reason why she
should<br>
 interfere with your majesty's plan."</p>

<p>"It is true. And yet-- Well, I wish she had been of my own<br>
 station. What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into
a<br>
 moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in
Serpentine<br>
 Avenue.</p>

<p>The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood
upon<br>
 the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped
from<br>
 the brougham.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with
a<br>
 questioning and rather startled gaze.</p>

<p>"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call.
She<br>
 left this morning, with her husband, by the 5:15 train from
Charing<br>
 Cross, for the Continent."</p>

<p>"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin
and<br>
 surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that she has left England?"</p>

<p>"Never to return."</p>

<p>"And the papers?" asked the king hoarsely. "All is lost!"</p>

<p>"We shall see." He pushed past the servant, and rushed into
the<br>
 drawing-room, followed by the king and myself. The furniture
was<br>
 scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves,
and<br>
 open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them
before<br>
 her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a
small<br>
 sliding shutter, and plunging in his hand, pulled out a
photograph<br>
 and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in
evening<br>
 dress; the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To
be<br>
 left till called for." My friend tore it open, and we all
three<br>
 read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding
night,<br>
 and ran in this way:</p>

<p><br>
 "MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well.
You<br>
 took me in completely. Until after the alarm of the fire, I
had<br>
 not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed
myself,<br>
 I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I
had<br>
 been told that if the king employed an agent, it would certainly
be<br>
 you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,
you<br>
 made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became<br>
 suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind
old<br>
 clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress<br>
 myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take
advantage<br>
 of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to
watch<br>
 you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them,
and<br>
 came down just as you departed.</p>

<p>"Well, I followed you to the door, and so made sure that I
was<br>
 really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
Holmes.<br>
 Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good night, and started
for<br>
 the Temple to see my husband.</p>

<p>"We both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by
so<br>
 formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when
you<br>
 call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest
in<br>
 peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The king
may<br>
 do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has
cruelly<br>
 wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and preserve a
weapon<br>
 which will always secure me from any steps which he might take
in<br>
 the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
possess;<br>
 and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, very truly yours,</p>

<p>"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."</p>

<p><br>
 "What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia,
when<br>
 we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how
quick<br>
 and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable
queen?<br>
 Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"</p>

<p>"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems indeed to be on
a<br>
 very different level to your majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I
am<br>
 sorry that I have not been able to bring your majesty's business
to<br>
 a more successful conclusion."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the king, "nothing could
be<br>
 more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The<br>
 photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear your majesty say so."</p>

<p>"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I
can<br>
 reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring
from<br>
 his finger, and held it out upon the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"Your majesty has something which I should value even more
highly,"<br>
 said Holmes.</p>

<p>"You have but to name it."</p>

<p>"This photograph!"</p>

<p>The king stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish
it."</p>

<p>"I thank your majesty. Then there is no more to be done in
the<br>
 matter. I have the honor to wish you a very good morning."
He<br>
 bowed, and turning away without observing the hand which the
king<br>
 had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his<br>
 chambers.</p>

<p>And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the
kingdom<br>
 of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes
were<br>
 beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the
cleverness<br>
 of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when
he<br>
 speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it
is<br>
 always under the honorable title of THE woman.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>The Red-Headed League</h2>

<p><br>
 I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in
the<br>
 autumn of last year, and found him in deep conversation with a
very<br>
 stout, florid-faced elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair.
With<br>
 an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when
Holmes<br>
 pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind
me.</p>

<p><br>
 "You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear<br>
 Watson," he said, cordially.</p>

<p>"I was afraid that you were engaged."</p>

<p>"So I am. Very much so."</p>

<p>"Then I can wait in the next room."</p>

<p>"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner
and<br>
 helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no
doubt<br>
 that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."</p>

<p>The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob
of<br>
 greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his
small,<br>
 fat-encircled eyes.</p>

<p>"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair,
and<br>
 putting his finger tips together, as was his custom when in<br>
 judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love
of<br>
 all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum
routine<br>
 of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the<br>
 enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you
will<br>
 excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own
little<br>
 adventures."</p>

<p>"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,"
I<br>
 observed.</p>

<p>"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before
we<br>
 went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary<br>
 Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary
combinations<br>
 we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than
any<br>
 effort of the imagination."</p>

<p>"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."</p>

<p>"You did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my
view,<br>
 for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you,
until<br>
 your reason breaks down under them and acknowledge me to be
right.<br>
 Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon
me<br>
 this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one
of<br>
 the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You
have<br>
 heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are
very<br>
 often connected not with the larger but with the smaller
crimes,<br>
 and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether
any<br>
 positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it
is<br>
 impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance
of<br>
 crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the
most<br>
 singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson,
you<br>
 would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I
ask<br>
 you, not merely because my friend, Dr. Watson, has not heard
the<br>
 opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the
story<br>
 makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.
As<br>
 a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course
of<br>
 events I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other
similar<br>
 cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am<br>
 forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my
belief,<br>
 unique."</p>

<p>The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of
some<br>
 little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from
the<br>
 inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the<br>
 advertisement column, with his head thrust forward, and the
paper<br>
 flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man,
and<br>
 endeavored, after the fashion of my companion, to read the<br>
 indications which might be presented by his dress or
appearance.</p>

<p>I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our
visitor<br>
 bore every mark of being an average commonplace British
tradesman,<br>
 obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy gray
shepherd's<br>
 check trousers, a not over-clean black frock coat, unbuttoned
in<br>
 the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert
chain,<br>
 and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament.
A<br>
 frayed top hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled
velvet<br>
 collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I
would,<br>
 there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing
red<br>
 head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon
his<br>
 features.</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes's quick eye took in my occupation, and he
shook his<br>
 head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.
"Beyond<br>
 the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor,
that<br>
 he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in
China,<br>
 and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I
can<br>
 deduce nothing else."</p>

<p>Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger
upon<br>
 the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.</p>

<p>How, in the name of good fortune, did you know all that,
Mr.<br>
 Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I
did<br>
 manual labor? It's as true as gospel, for I began as a
ship's<br>
 carpenter."</p>

<p>"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size
larger<br>
 than your left. You have worked with it and the muscles are
more<br>
 developed."</p>

<p>"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"</p>

<p>"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read
that,<br>
 especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order,
you<br>
 use an arc and compass breastpin."</p>

<p>"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"</p>

<p>"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny
for<br>
 five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the
elbow<br>
 where you rest it upon the desk."</p>

<p>"Well, but China?"</p>

<p>"The fish which you have tattooed immediately above your
wrist<br>
 could only have been done in China. I have made a small study
of<br>
 tattoo marks, and have even contributed to the literature of
the<br>
 subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a
delicate<br>
 pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a<br>
 Chinese coin hanging from your watch chain, the matter becomes
even<br>
 more simple."</p>

<p>Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he.
"I<br>
 thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see
that<br>
 there was nothing in it after all."</p>

<p>"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a
mistake in<br>
 explaining. 'Omne ignotom pro magnifico,' you know, and my
poor<br>
 little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am
so<br>
 candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have got it now," he answered, with his thick, red
finger<br>
 planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what
began<br>
 it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."</p>

<p>I took the paper from him and read as follows:</p>

<p><br>
 "TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the
late<br>
 Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U. S. A., there is now
another<br>
 vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary
of<br>
 four pounds a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed
men<br>
 who are sound in body and mind and above the age of
twenty-one<br>
 years are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven
o'clock,<br>
 to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court,
Fleet<br>
 Street."</p>

<p><br>
 "What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated, after I had
twice<br>
 read over the extraordinary announcement.</p>

<p>Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit
when in<br>
 high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't
it?"<br>
 said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell
us<br>
 all about yourself, your household, and the effect which
this<br>
 advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a
note,<br>
 doctor, of the paper and the date."</p>

<p>"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two
months<br>
 ago."</p>

<p>"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson."</p>

<p>"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock
Holmes,"<br>
 said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead, "I have a small<br>
 pawnbroker's business at Saxe-Coburg Square, near the City.
It's<br>
 not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done
more<br>
 than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two<br>
 assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to
pay<br>
 him but that he is willing to come for half wages, so as to
learn<br>
 the business."</p>

<p>"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock
Holmes.</p>

<p>"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth
either.<br>
 It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter
assistant,<br>
 Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself,
and<br>
 earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he
is<br>
 satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employee
who<br>
 comes under the full market price. It is not a common
experience<br>
 among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant
is<br>
 not as remarkable as your advertisement."</p>

<p>"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such
a<br>
 fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he
ought<br>
 to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar
like<br>
 a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his
main<br>
 fault; but, on the whole, he's a good worker. There's no vice
in<br>
 him."</p>

<p>"He is still with you, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of
simple<br>
 cooking, and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the
house,<br>
 for I am a widower, and never had any family. We live very<br>
 quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our
heads,<br>
 and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.</p>

<p>"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.<br>
 Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight
weeks,<br>
 with this very paper in his hand, and he says:</p>

<p>"'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a redheaded
man.'</p>

<p>"'Why that?' I asks.</p>

<p>"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the
Red-<br>
 headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who
gets<br>
 it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there
are<br>
 men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do
with<br>
 the money. If my hair would only change color here's a nice
little<br>
 crib all ready for me to step into.'</p>

<p>"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am
a<br>
 very stay-at-home man, and, as my business came to me instead of
my<br>
 having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting
my<br>
 foot over the door mat. In that way I didn't know much of what
was<br>
 going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.</p>

<p>"'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?'
he<br>
 asked, with his eyes open.</p>

<p>"'Never.'</p>

<p>"'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one
of<br>
 the vacancies.'</p>

<p>"'And what are they worth?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is
slight,<br>
 and it need not interfere very much with one's other
occupations.'</p>

<p>"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my
ears, for<br>
 the business has not been over good for some years, and an
extra<br>
 couple of hundred would have been very handy.</p>

<p>"'Tell me all about it,' said I.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see
for<br>
 yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the
address<br>
 where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make
out,<br>
 the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah
Hopkins,<br>
 who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed,
and<br>
 he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he
died,<br>
 it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands
of<br>
 trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the
providing<br>
 of easy berths to men whose hair is of that color. From all I
hear<br>
 it is splendid pay, and very little to do.'</p>

<p>"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men
who<br>
 would apply.'</p>

<p>"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it
is<br>
 really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American
had<br>
 started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the
old<br>
 town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is of no use
your<br>
 applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything
but<br>
 real, bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply,
Mr.<br>
 Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly
be<br>
 worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of
a<br>
 few hundred pounds.'</p>

<p>"Now it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,
that<br>
 my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to
me<br>
 that, if there was to be any competition in the matter, I stood
as<br>
 good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent
Spaulding<br>
 seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might
prove<br>
 useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the
day,<br>
 and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have
a<br>
 holiday, so we shut the business up, and started off for the<br>
 address that was given us in the advertisement.</p>

<p>"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes.
From<br>
 north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red
in<br>
 his hair had tramped into the City to answer the
advertisement.<br>
 Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's
Court<br>
 looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have
thought<br>
 there were so many in the whole country as were brought together
by<br>
 that single advertisement. Every shade of color they
were--straw,<br>
 lemon, orange, brick, Irish setter, liver, clay; but, as
Spaulding<br>
 said, there were not many who had the real vivid
flame-colored<br>
 tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it
up<br>
 in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it
I<br>
 could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he
got<br>
 me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to
the<br>
 office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up
in<br>
 hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as
we<br>
 could, and soon found ourselves in the office."</p>

<p>"Your experience has been a most entertaining one,"
remarked<br>
 Holmes, as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a
huge<br>
 pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting
statement."</p>

<p>"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs
and<br>
 a deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that
was<br>
 even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as
he<br>
 came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in
them<br>
 which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to
be<br>
 such a very easy matter after all. However, when our turn
came,<br>
 the little man was much more favorable to me than to any of
the<br>
 others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might
have<br>
 a private word with us.</p>

<p>"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is
willing<br>
 to fill a vacancy in the League.'</p>

<p>"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He
has<br>
 every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything
so<br>
 fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side,
and<br>
 gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly
he<br>
 plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on
my<br>
 success.</p>

<p>"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,
however,<br>
 I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With
that<br>
 he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled
with<br>
 the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he, as he
released<br>
 me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to
be<br>
 careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by
paint.<br>
 I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust
you<br>
 with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and
shouted<br>
 through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled.
A<br>
 groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all<br>
 trooped away in different directions, until there was not a
red<br>
 head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.</p>

<p>"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one
of<br>
 the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are
you<br>
 a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'</p>

<p>"I answered that I had not.</p>

<p>"His face fell immediately.</p>

<p>"'Dear me!' he said, gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I
am<br>
 sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the<br>
 propagation and spread of the red heads as well as for their<br>
 maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be
a<br>
 bachelor.'</p>

<p>"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I
was<br>
 not to have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over
for<br>
 a few minutes, he said that it would be all right.</p>

<p>"'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be
fatal,<br>
 but we must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head
of<br>
 hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new<br>
 duties?'</p>

<p>"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business
already,'<br>
 said I.</p>

<p>"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent
Spaulding.<br>
 'I shall be able to look after that for you.'</p>

<p>"'What would be the hours?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Ten to two.'</p>

<p>"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening,
Mr.<br>
 Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evenings, which is
just<br>
 before pay day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little
in<br>
 the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good
man,<br>
 and that he would see to anything that turned up.</p>

<p>"'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'</p>

<p>"'Is four pounds a week.'</p>

<p>"'And the work?'</p>

<p>"'Is purely nominal.'</p>

<p>"'What do you call purely nominal?'</p>

<p>"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the
building,<br>
 the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole
position<br>
 forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't
comply<br>
 with the conditions if you budge from the office during that
time.'</p>

<p>"'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of
leaving,'<br>
 said I.</p>

<p>"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross, 'neither
sickness,<br>
 nor business, nor anything else. There you must stay, or you
lose<br>
 your billet.'</p>

<p>"'And the work?'</p>

<p>"'Is to copy out the "Encyclopaedia Britannica." There is
the<br>
 first volume of it in that press. You must find your own
ink,<br>
 pens, and blotting paper, but we provide this table and
chair.<br>
 Will you be ready to-morrow?'</p>

<p><br>
 "'Certainly,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'Then, good-by, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you
once<br>
 more on the important position which you have been fortunate
enough<br>
 to gain.' He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with
my<br>
 assistant hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at
my<br>
 own good fortune.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was
in<br>
 low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the
whole<br>
 affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its
object<br>
 might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past
belief<br>
 that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such
a<br>
 sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the
'Encyclopaedia<br>
 Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me
up,<br>
 but by bed time I had reasoned myself out of the whole
thing.<br>
 However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it
anyhow,<br>
 so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill pen and
seven<br>
 sheets of foolscap paper I started off for Pope's Court.</p>

<p>"Well, to my surprise and delight everything was as right
as<br>
 possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan
Ross<br>
 was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off
upon<br>
 the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from
time<br>
 to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he
bade<br>
 me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had
written,<br>
 and locked the door of the office after me.</p>

<p>"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday
the<br>
 manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for
my<br>
 week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the
week<br>
 after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon
I<br>
 left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in
only<br>
 once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in
at<br>
 all. Still, of course. I never dared to leave the room for
an<br>
 instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet
was<br>
 such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk
the<br>
 loss of it.</p>

<p>"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about
Abbots,<br>
 and Archery, and Armor, and Architecture, and Attica, and
hoped<br>
 with diligence that I might get on to the Bs before very long.
It<br>
 cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled
a<br>
 shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business
came<br>
 to an end."</p>

<p>"To an end?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work
as<br>
 usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with
a<br>
 little square of cardboard hammered onto the middle of the
panel<br>
 with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."</p>

<p>He held up a piece of white cardboard, about the size of a
sheet of<br>
 note paper. It read in this fashion:</p>

<p><br>
 "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED.</p>

<p>Oct. 9, 1890."</p>

<p><br>
 Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and
the<br>
 rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair
so<br>
 completely overtopped every consideration that we both burst
out<br>
 into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our
client,<br>
 flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do<br>
 nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from
which<br>
 he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for the<br>
 world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you
will<br>
 excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
Pray<br>
 what steps did you take when you found the card upon the
door?"</p>

<p>"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I
called<br>
 at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know
anything<br>
 about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an
accountant<br>
 living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell
me<br>
 what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he
had<br>
 never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan
Ross<br>
 was. He answered that the name was new to him.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'</p>

<p>"'What, the red-headed man?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a
solicitor,<br>
 and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his
new<br>
 premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'</p>

<p>"'Where could I find him?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes,
17<br>
 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'</p>

<p>"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it
was a<br>
 manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had
ever<br>
 heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."</p>

<p>"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.</p>

<p>"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of
my<br>
 assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only
say<br>
 that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not
quite<br>
 good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place<br>
 without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough
to<br>
 give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right
away<br>
 to you."</p>

<p>"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an<br>
 exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into
it.<br>
 From what you have told me I think that it is possible that
graver<br>
 issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."</p>

<p>"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost
four<br>
 pound a week."</p>

<p>"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I
do<br>
 not see that you have any grievance against this
extraordinary<br>
 league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by
some<br>
 thirty pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which
you<br>
 have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A.
You<br>
 have lost nothing by them."</p>

<p>"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,
and<br>
 what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a
prank--<br>
 upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost
them<br>
 two-and-thirty pounds."</p>

<p>"We shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. And,
first,<br>
 one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours
who<br>
 first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had
he<br>
 been with you?"</p>

<p>"About a month then."</p>

<p>"How did he come?"</p>

<p>"In answer to an advertisement."</p>

<p>"Was he the only applicant?"</p>

<p>"No, I had a dozen."</p>

<p>"Why did you pick him?"</p>

<p>"Because he was handy and would come cheap."</p>

<p>"At half wages, in fact."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"</p>

<p>"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his
face,<br>
 though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid
upon<br>
 his forehead."</p>

<p>Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. I
thought<br>
 as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are<br>
 pierced for earrings?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he
was<br>
 a lad."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is
still<br>
 with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."</p>

<p>"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of
a<br>
 morning."</p>

<p>"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an
opinion<br>
 upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is<br>
 Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a
conclusion."</p>

<p>"Well, Watson," said Holmes, when our visitor had left us,
"what do<br>
 you make of it all?"</p>

<p>"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most<br>
 mysterious business."</p>

<p>"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the
less<br>
 mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace,
featureless<br>
 crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is
the<br>
 most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this<br>
 matter."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three-pipe problem,
and I<br>
 beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled<br>
 himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his<br>
 hawklike nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his
black<br>
 clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I
had<br>
 come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed
was<br>
 nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with
the<br>
 gesture of a man who has made up his mind, and put his pipe
down<br>
 upon the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"Sarasate plays at St. James's Hall this afternoon," he
remarked.<br>
 "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for
a<br>
 few hours?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very<br>
 absorbing."</p>

<p>"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City
first,<br>
 and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is
a<br>
 good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more
to<br>
 my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I
want<br>
 to introspect. Come along!"</p>

<p>We traveled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a
short<br>
 walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular
story<br>
 which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,
little,<br>
 shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy, two-storied
brick<br>
 houses looked out into a small railed-in inclosure, where a lawn
of<br>
 weedy grass, and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a
hard<br>
 fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three
gilt<br>
 balls and a brown board with JABEZ WILSON in white letters, upon
a<br>
 corner house, announced the place where our red-headed
client<br>
 carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of
it<br>
 with his head on one side, and looked it all over, with his
eyes<br>
 shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly
up<br>
 the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking
keenly<br>
 at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's and,
having<br>
 thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or
three<br>
 times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly
opened<br>
 by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him
to<br>
 step in.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you
would<br>
 go from here to the Strand."</p>

<p>"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant,
promptly,<br>
 closing the door.</p>

<p>"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He
is,<br>
 in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for
daring I<br>
 am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have
known<br>
 something of him before."</p>

<p>"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good
deal<br>
 in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you<br>
 inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."</p>

<p>"Not him."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"The knees of his trousers."</p>

<p>"And what did you see?"</p>

<p>"What I expected to see."</p>

<p>"Why did you beat the pavement?"</p>

<p>"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.
We<br>
 are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of
Saxe-Coburg<br>
 Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."</p>

<p>The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
corner<br>
 from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a
contrast<br>
 to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one
of<br>
 the main arteries which convey the traffic of the City to the
north<br>
 and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of<br>
 commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while
the<br>
 footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians.
It<br>
 was difficult to realize, as we looked at the line of fine
shops<br>
 and stately business premises, that they really abutted on
the<br>
 other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had
just<br>
 quitted.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner, and
glancing<br>
 along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of
the<br>
 houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge
of<br>
 London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist; the little
newspaper<br>
 shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the<br>
 Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building
depot.<br>
 That carries us right on to the other block. And now,
doctor,<br>
 we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich
and<br>
 a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is<br>
 sweetness, and delicacy, and harmony, and there are no
red-headed<br>
 clients to vex us with their conundrums."</p>

<p>My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only
a<br>
 very capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit.
All<br>
 the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most
perfect<br>
 happiness, gently waving his long thin fingers in time to
the<br>
 music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy
eyes<br>
 were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the<br>
 relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it
was<br>
 possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual
nature<br>
 alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and<br>
 astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the
reaction<br>
 against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally<br>
 predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
extreme<br>
 languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never
so<br>
 truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging
in<br>
 his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter
editions.<br>
 Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come
upon<br>
 him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the
level<br>
 of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his
methods<br>
 would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not
that<br>
 of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped
in<br>
 the music at St. James's Hall, I felt that an evil time might
be<br>
 coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.</p>

<p>"You want to go home, no doubt, doctor," he remarked, as
we<br>
 emerged.</p>

<p>"Yes, it would be as well."</p>

<p>"And I have some business to do which will take some hours.
This<br>
 business at Saxe-Coburg Square is serious."</p>

<p>"Why serious?"</p>

<p>"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason
to<br>
 believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day
being<br>
 Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help
to-<br>
 night."</p>

<p>"At what time?"</p>

<p>"Ten will be early enough."</p>

<p>I shall be at Baker Street at ten."</p>

<p>"Very well. And, I say, doctor! there may be some little
danger,<br>
 so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved
his<br>
 hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among
the<br>
 crowd.</p>

<p>I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I
was<br>
 always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my
dealings<br>
 with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I
had<br>
 seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident
that<br>
 he saw clearly not only what had happened, but what was about
to<br>
 happen, while to me the whole business was still confused
and<br>
 grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I
thought<br>
 over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed
copier<br>
 of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square,
and<br>
 the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was
this<br>
 nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were
we<br>
 going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes
that<br>
 this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable
man--a<br>
 man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but
gave<br>
 it up in despair, and set the matter aside until night should
bring<br>
 an explanation.</p>

<p>It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made
my way<br>
 across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street.
Two<br>
 hansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the
passage, I<br>
 heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room,
I<br>
 found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom
I<br>
 recognized as Peter Jones, the official police agent; while
the<br>
 other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat
and<br>
 oppressively respectable frock coat.</p>

<p>"Ha! our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his
pea-<br>
 jacket, and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
"Watson,<br>
 I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce
you<br>
 to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in
to-night's<br>
 adventure."</p>

<p>"We're hunting in couples again, doctor, you see," said Jones,
in<br>
 his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man
for<br>
 starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him do
the<br>
 running down."</p>

<p>"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our
chase,"<br>
 observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.</p>

<p>"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,"
said<br>
 the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods,
which<br>
 are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too
theoretical<br>
 and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It
is<br>
 not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of
the<br>
 Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly<br>
 correct than the official force."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right!" said the
stranger,<br>
 with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It
is<br>
 the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have
not<br>
 had my rubber."</p>

<p>"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will
play<br>
 for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and
that<br>
 the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,
the<br>
 stake will be some thirty thousand pounds; and for you, Jones,
it<br>
 will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."</p>

<p>"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a
young<br>
 man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession,
and<br>
 I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal
in<br>
 London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His<br>
 grandfather was a Royal Duke, and he himself has been to Eton
and<br>
 Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we
meet<br>
 signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the
man<br>
 himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be
raising<br>
 money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on
his<br>
 track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet."</p>

<p>"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you
to-night.<br>
 I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and
I<br>
 agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It
is<br>
 past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two
will<br>
 take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the
second."</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long
drive,<br>
 and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in
the<br>
 afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit<br>
 streets until we emerged into Farringdon Street.</p>

<p>"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow<br>
 Merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in
the<br>
 matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He
is<br>
 not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his
profession.<br>
 He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog, and
as<br>
 tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here
we<br>
 are, and they are waiting for us."</p>

<p>We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had
found<br>
 ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and
following<br>
 the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow
passage,<br>
 and through a side door which he opened for us. Within there was
a<br>
 small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This
also<br>
 was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps,
which<br>
 terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped
to<br>
 light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark,
earth-smelling<br>
 passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault
or<br>
 cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive
boxes.</p>

<p>"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked, as
he<br>
 held up the lantern and gazed about him.</p>

<p>"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick
upon<br>
 the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds
quite<br>
 hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.</p>

<p>"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet," said
Holmes<br>
 severely. "You have already imperiled the whole success of
our<br>
 expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to
sit<br>
 down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"</p>

<p>The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with
a<br>
 very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon
his<br>
 knees upon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying
lens,<br>
 began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A
few<br>
 seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet
again,<br>
 and put his glass in his pocket.</p>

<p>"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they
can<br>
 hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in
bed.<br>
 Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their
work<br>
 the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at<br>
 present, doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of
the<br>
 City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.
Merryweather<br>
 is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that
there<br>
 are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take
a<br>
 considerable interest in this cellar at present."</p>

<p><br>
 "It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have
had<br>
 several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."</p>

<p>"Your French gold?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our
resources,<br>
 and borrowed, for that purpose, thirty thousand napoleons from
the<br>
 Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had<br>
 occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in
our<br>
 cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains two thousand
napoleons<br>
 packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is
much<br>
 larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch
office,<br>
 and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."</p>

<p>"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it
is<br>
 time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within
an<br>
 hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime, Mr.<br>
 Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark
lantern."</p>

<p>"And sit in the dark?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket,
and I<br>
 thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have
your<br>
 rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations
have<br>
 gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light.
And,<br>
 first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring
men,<br>
 and, though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do
us<br>
 some harm, unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this
crate,<br>
 and do you conceal yourself behind those. Then, when I flash
a<br>
 light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have
no<br>
 compunction about shooting them down."</p>

<p>I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden
case<br>
 behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front
of<br>
 his lantern, and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute<br>
 darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of
hot<br>
 metal remained to assure us that the light was still there,
ready<br>
 to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked
up<br>
 to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and<br>
 subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold, dank air of
the<br>
 vault.</p>

<p>"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is
back<br>
 through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you
have<br>
 done what I asked you, Jones?"</p>

<p>"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front
door."</p>

<p>"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent
and<br>
 wait."</p>

<p>What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards, it was
but<br>
 an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night
must<br>
 have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs
were<br>
 weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position, yet my
nerves<br>
 were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing
was<br>
 so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of
my<br>
 companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier inbreath
of<br>
 the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank
director.<br>
 From my position I could look over the case in the direction of
the<br>
 floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.</p>

<p>At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement.
Then it<br>
 lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without
any<br>
 warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared,
a<br>
 white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the center of
the<br>
 little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with
its<br>
 writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was<br>
 withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again
save<br>
 the single lurid spark, which marked a chink between the
stones.</p>

<p>Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a
rending,<br>
 tearing sound, one of the broad white stones turned over upon
its<br>
 side, and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed
the<br>
 light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,
boyish<br>
 face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on
either<br>
 side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and
waist-high,<br>
 until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he
stood<br>
 at the side of the hole, and was hauling after him a
companion,<br>
 lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of
very<br>
 red hair.</p>

<p>"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the
bags?<br>
 Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by
the<br>
 collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound
of<br>
 rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light
flashed<br>
 upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes's hunting crop came
down<br>
 on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone
floor.</p>

<p>"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly, "you have no
chance<br>
 at all."</p>

<p>"So I see," the other answered, with the utmost coolness. "I
fancy<br>
 that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his
coat-<br>
 tails."</p>

<p>"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said
Holmes.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed. You seem to have done the thing very completely.
I<br>
 must compliment you."</p>

<p>"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very
new<br>
 and effective."</p>

<p>"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's
quicker<br>
 at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix
the<br>
 derbies."</p>

<p>"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"
remarked<br>
 our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You
may<br>
 not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the<br>
 goodness also, when you address me, always to say 'sir' and<br>
 'please.'"</p>

<p>"All right," said Jones, with a stare and a snigger. "Well,
would<br>
 you please, sir, march upstairs where we can get a cab to
carry<br>
 your highness to the police station?"</p>

<p>"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping
bow<br>
 to the three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of
the<br>
 detective.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed
them<br>
 from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or
repay<br>
 you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in
the<br>
 most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at
bank<br>
 robbery that have ever come within my experience."</p>

<p>"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with
Mr.<br>
 John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense
over<br>
 this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but
beyond<br>
 that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in
many<br>
 ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of
the<br>
 Red-headed League."</p>

<p><br>
 "You see, Watson," he explained, in the early hours of the
morning,<br>
 as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it
was<br>
 perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object
of<br>
 this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the
League,<br>
 and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get this
not<br>
 over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours
every<br>
 day. It was a curious way of managing it, but really it would
be<br>
 difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt
suggested<br>
 to Clay's ingenious mind by the color of his accomplice's
hair.<br>
 The four pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what
was<br>
 it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the<br>
 advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other
rogue<br>
 incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to
secure<br>
 his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I
heard<br>
 of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to
me<br>
 that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."</p>

<p>"But how could you guess what the motive was?"</p>

<p>"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a
mere<br>
 vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The<br>
 man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his
house<br>
 which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such
an<br>
 expenditure as they were at. It must then be something out of
the<br>
 house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's
fondness<br>
 for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar.
The<br>
 cellar! There was the end of this tangled clew. Then I made<br>
 inquiries as to this mysterious assistant, and found that I had
to<br>
 deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in
London.<br>
 He was doing something in the cellar--something which took
many<br>
 hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more?
I<br>
 could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to
some<br>
 other building.</p>

<p>"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action.
I<br>
 surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I
was<br>
 ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or
behind.<br>
 It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped,
the<br>
 assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we
had<br>
 never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at
his<br>
 face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself
have<br>
 remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke
of<br>
 those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what
they<br>
 were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw that the
City<br>
 and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt
that I<br>
 had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert
I<br>
 called upon Scotland Yard, and upon the chairman of the bank<br>
 directors, with the result that you have seen."</p>

<p>"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
to-<br>
 night?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign
that<br>
 they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence; in
other<br>
 words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was
essential<br>
 that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or
the<br>
 bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than
any<br>
 other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
For<br>
 all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."</p>

<p>"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed, in
unfeigned<br>
 admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings<br>
 true."</p>

<p>"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I
already<br>
 feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort
to<br>
 escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little
problems<br>
 help me to do so."</p>

<p>"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I. He shrugged
his<br>
 shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little
use,"<br>
 he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as<br>
 Gustave Flaubert wrote to Georges Sands."</p>

<h2>The Baron's Quarry</h2>

<p><br>
 "Oh, no, I assure you, you are not boring Mr. Marshfield,"
said<br>
 this personage himself in his gentle voice--that curious voice
that<br>
 could flow on for hours, promulgating profound and startling<br>
 theories on every department of human knowledge or
conducting<br>
 paradoxical arguments without a single inflection or pause
of<br>
 hesitation. "I am, on the contrary, much interested in your<br>
 hunting talk. To paraphrase a well-worn quotation somewhat
widely,<br>
 nihil humanum a me alienum est. Even hunting stories may
have<br>
 their point of biological interest; the philologist
sometimes<br>
 pricks his ear to the jargon of the chase; moreover, I am
not<br>
 incapable of appreciating the subject matter itself. This seems
to<br>
 excite some derision. I admit I am not much of a sportsman to
look<br>
 at, nor, indeed, by instinct, yet I have had some
out-of-the-way<br>
 experiences in that line--generally when intent on other
pursuits.<br>
 I doubt, for instance, if even you, Major Travers,
notwithstanding<br>
 your well-known exploits against man and beast,
notwithstanding<br>
 that doubtful smile of yours, could match the strangeness of
a<br>
 certain hunting adventure in which I played an important
part."</p>

<p><br>
 The speaker's small, deep-set, black eyes, that never warmed
to<br>
 anything more human than a purely speculative scientific
interest<br>
 in his surroundings, here wandered round the skeptical yet<br>
 expectant circle with bland amusement. He stretched out his<br>
 bloodless fingers for another of his host's superfine cigars
and<br>
 proceeded, with only such interruptions as were occasioned by
the<br>
 lighting and careful smoking of the latter.</p>

<p>"I was returning home after my prolonged stay in
Petersburg,<br>
 intending to linger on my way and test with mine own ears
certain<br>
 among the many dialects of Eastern Europe--anent which there is
a<br>
 symmetrical little cluster of philological knotty points it is
my<br>
 modest intention one day to unravel. However, that is neither
here<br>
 nor there. On the road to Hungary I bethought myself
opportunely<br>
 of proving the once pressingly offered hospitality of the
Baron<br>
 Kossowski.</p>

<p>"You may have met the man, Major Travers; he was a
tremendous<br>
 sportsman, if you like. I first came across him at McNeil's
place<br>
 in remote Ireland. Now, being in Bukowina, within measurable<br>
 distance of his Carpathian abode, and curious to see a Polish
lord<br>
 at home, I remembered his invitation. It was already of long<br>
 standing, but it had been warm, born in fact of a sudden fit
of<br>
 enthusiasm for me"--here a half-mocking smile quivered an
instant<br>
 under the speaker's black mustache--"which, as it was<br>
 characteristic, I may as well tell you about.</p>

<p>"It was on the day of, or, rather, to be accurate, on the day
after<br>
 my arrival, toward the small hours of the morning, in the
smoking<br>
 room at Rathdrum. Our host was peacefully snoring over his
empty<br>
 pipe and his seventh glass of whisky, also empty. The rest of
the<br>
 men had slunk off to bed. The baron, who all unknown to
himself<br>
 had been a subject of most interesting observation to me the
whole<br>
 evening, being now practically alone with me, condescended to
turn<br>
 an eye, as wide awake as a fox's, albeit slightly bloodshot,
upon<br>
 the contemptible white-faced person who had preferred spending
the<br>
 raw hours over his papers, within the radius of a glorious
fire's<br>
 warmth, to creeping slyly over treacherous quagmires in the
pursuit<br>
 of timid bog creatures (snipe shooting had been the order of
the<br>
 day)--the baron, I say, became aware of my existence and
entered<br>
 into conversation with me.</p>

<p>"He would no doubt have been much surprised could he have
known<br>
 that he was already mapped out, craniologically and<br>
 physiognomically, catalogued with care and neatly laid by in
his<br>
 proper ethnological box, in my private type museum; that, as I
sat<br>
 and examined him from my different coigns of vantage in library,
in<br>
 dining and smoking room that evening, not a look of his, not
a<br>
 gesture went forth but had significance for me.</p>

<p>"You, I had thought, with your broad shoulders and deep chest;
your<br>
 massive head that should have gone with a tall stature, not
with<br>
 those short sturdy limbs; with your thick red hair, that
should<br>
 have been black for that matter, as should your wide-set
yellow<br>
 eyes--you would be a real puzzle to one who did not recognize
in<br>
 you equal mixtures of the fair, stalwart and muscular Slav with
the<br>
 bilious-sanguine, thick-set, wiry Turanian. Your pedigree would
no<br>
 doubt bear me out: there is as much of the Magyar as of the Pole
in<br>
 your anatomy. Athlete, and yet a tangle of nerves; a
ferocious<br>
 brute at bottom, I dare say, for your broad forehead inclines
to<br>
 flatness; under your bristling beard your jaw must protrude,
and<br>
 the base of your skull is ominously thick. And, with all
that,<br>
 capable of ideal transports: when that girl played and sang
to-<br>
 night I saw the swelling of your eyelid veins, and how that
small,<br>
 tenacious, claw-like hand of yours twitched! You would be a
fine<br>
 leader of men--but God help the wretches in your power!</p>

<p>"So had I mused upon him. Yet I confess that when we came
in<br>
 closer contact with each other, even I was not proof against
the<br>
 singular courtesy of his manner and his unaccountable
personal<br>
 charm.</p>

<p>"Our conversation soon grew interesting; to me as a matter
of<br>
 course, and evidently to him also. A few general words led
to<br>
 interchange of remarks upon the country we were both visitors
in<br>
 and so to national characteristics--Pole and Irishman have not
a<br>
 few in common, both in their nature and history. An
observation<br>
 which he made, not without a certain flash in his light eyes and
a<br>
 transient uncovering of the teeth, on the Irish type of
female<br>
 beauty suddenly suggested to me a stanza of an ancient
Polish<br>
 ballad, very full of milk-and-blood imagery, of alternating<br>
 ferocity and voluptuousness. This I quoted to the astounded<br>
 foreigner in the vernacular, and this it was that metamorphosed
his<br>
 mere perfection of civility into sudden warmth, and, in
fact,<br>
 procured me the invitation in question.</p>

<p>"When I left Rathdrum the baron's last words to me were that
if I<br>
 ever thought of visiting his country otherwise than in books,
he<br>
 held me bound to make Yany, his Galician seat, my headquarters
of<br>
 study.</p>

<p>"From Czernowicz, therefore, where I stopped some time, I
wrote,<br>
 received in due time a few lines of prettily worded reply,
and<br>
 ultimately entered my sled in the nearest town to, yet at a
most<br>
 forbidding distance from, Yany, and started on my journey
thither.</p>

<p>"The undertaking meant many long hours of undulation and
skidding<br>
 over the November snow, to the somniferous bell jangle of my
dirty<br>
 little horses, the only impression of interest being a weird
gypsy<br>
 concert I came in for at a miserable drinking-booth half buried
in<br>
 the snow where we halted for the refreshment of man and
beast.<br>
 Here, I remember, I discovered a very definite connection
between<br>
 the characteristic run of the tsimbol, the peculiar bite of
the<br>
 Zigeuner's bow on his fiddle-string, and some distinctive points
of<br>
 Turanian tongues. In other countries, in Spain, for instance,
your<br>
 gypsy speaks differently on his instrument. But, oddly
enough,<br>
 when I later attempted to put this observation on paper I
could<br>
 find no word to express it."</p>

<p>A few of our company evinced signs of sleepiness, but most of
us<br>
 who knew Marshfield, and that he could, unless he had
something<br>
 novel to say, be as silent and retiring as he now evinced signs
of<br>
 being copious, awaited further developments with patience. He
has<br>
 his own deliberate way of speaking, which he evidently
enjoys<br>
 greatly, though it be occasionally trying to his listeners.</p>

<p>"On the afternoon of my second day's drive, the snow, which
till<br>
 then had fallen fine and continuous, ceased, and my Jehu,
suddenly<br>
 interrupting himself in the midst of some exciting wolf story
quite<br>
 in keeping with the time of year and the wild surroundings,
pointed<br>
 to a distant spot against the gray sky to the northwest,
between<br>
 two wood-covered folds of ground--the first eastern spurs of
the<br>
 great Carpathian chain.</p>

<p>"'There stands Yany,' said he. I looked at my far-off goal
with<br>
 interest. As we drew nearer, the sinking sun, just dipping
behind<br>
 the hills, tinged the now distinct frontage with a cold
copper-like<br>
 gleam, but it was only for a minute; the next the building
became<br>
 nothing more to the eye than a black irregular silhouette
against<br>
 the crimson sky.</p>

<p>"Before we entered the long, steep avenue of poplars, the
early<br>
 winter darkness was upon us, rendered all the more depressing
by<br>
 gray mists which gave a ghostly aspect to such objects as the
sheen<br>
 of the snow rendered visible. Once or twice there were
feeble<br>
 flashes of light looming in iridescent halos as we passed
little<br>
 clusters of hovels, but for which I should have been induced
to<br>
 fancy that the great Hof stood alone in the wilderness, such
was<br>
 the deathly stillness around. But even as the tall, square<br>
 building rose before us above the vapor, yellow lighted in
various<br>
 stories, and mighty in height and breadth, there broke upon my
ear<br>
 a deep-mouthed, menacing bay, which gave at once almost
alarming<br>
 reality to the eerie surroundings. 'His lordship's boar and
wolf<br>
 hounds,' quoth my charioteer calmly, unmindful of the
regular<br>
 pandemonium of howls and barks which ensued as he skillfully
turned<br>
 his horses through the gateway and flogged the tired beasts into
a<br>
 sort of shambling canter that we might land with glory before
the<br>
 house door: a weakness common, I believe, to drivers of all<br>
 nations.</p>

<p>"I alighted in the court of honor, and while awaiting an
answer to<br>
 my tug at the bell, stood, broken with fatigue, depressed,
chilled<br>
 and aching, questioning the wisdom of my proceedings and the
amount<br>
 of comfort, physical and moral, that was likely to await me in
a<br>
 tete-a-tete visit with a well-mannered savage in his own
home.</p>

<p>"The unkempt tribe of stable retainers who began to gather
round me<br>
 and my rough vehicle in the gloom, with their evil-smelling<br>
 sheepskins and their resigned, battered visages, were not<br>
 calculated to reassure me. Yet when the door opened, there stood
a<br>
 smart chasseur and a solemn major-domo who might but just
have<br>
 stepped out of Mayfair; and there was displayed a spreading
vista<br>
 of warm, deep-colored halls, with here a statue and there a
stuffed<br>
 bear, and under foot pile carpets strewn with rarest skins.</p>

<p>"Marveling, yet comforted withal, I followed the solemn
butler, who<br>
 received me with the deference due to an expected guest and<br>
 expressed the master's regret for his enforced absence till
dinner<br>
 time. I traversed vast rooms, each more sumptuous than the
last,<br>
 feeling the strangeness of the contrast between the outer<br>
 desolation and this sybaritic excess of luxury growing ever
more<br>
 strongly upon me; caught a glimpse of a picture gallery,
where<br>
 peculiar yet admirably executed latter-day French pictures
hung<br>
 side by side with ferocious boar hunts of Snyder and such kin;
and,<br>
 at length, was ushered into a most cheerful room, modern to
excess<br>
 in its comfortable promise, where, in addition to the tall
stove<br>
 necessary for warmth, there burned on an open hearth a
vastly<br>
 pleasant fire of resinous logs, and where, on a low table,
awaited<br>
 me a dainty service of fragrant Russian tea.</p>

<p>"My impression of utter novelty seemed somehow enhanced by
this<br>
 unexpected refinement in the heart of the solitudes and in such
a<br>
 rugged shell, and yet, when I came to reflect, it was only<br>
 characteristic of my cosmopolitan host. But another surprise
was<br>
 in store for me.</p>

<p>"When I had recovered bodily warmth and mental equilibrium in
my<br>
 downy armchair, before the roaring logs, and during the
delicious<br>
 absorption of my second glass of tea, I turned my attention to
the<br>
 French valet, evidently the baron's own man, who was deftly<br>
 unpacking my portmanteau, and who, unless my practiced eye
deceived<br>
 me, asked for nothing better than to entertain me with
agreeable<br>
 conversation the while.</p>

<p>"'Your master is out, then?' quoth I, knowing that the most
trivial<br>
 remark would suffice to start him.</p>

<p>"True, Monseigneur was out; he was desolated in despair (this
with<br>
 the national amiable and imaginative instinct); 'but it was<br>
 doubtless important business. M. le Baron had the visit of
his<br>
 factor during the midday meal; had left the table hurriedly,
and<br>
 had not been seen since. Madame la Baronne had been a little<br>
 suffering, but she would receive monsieur!'</p>

<p>"'Madame!' exclaimed I, astounded, 'is your master then
married?--<br>
 since when?'--visions of a fair Tartar, fit mate for my
baron,<br>
 immediately springing somewhat alluringly before my mental
vision.<br>
 But the answer dispelled the picturesque fancy.</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes,' said the man, with a somewhat peculiar
expression.<br>
 Yes, Monseigneur is married. Did Monsieur not know? And yet
it<br>
 was from England that Monseigneur brought back his wife.'</p>

<p>"'An Englishwoman!'</p>

<p>"My first thought was one of pity; an Englishwoman alone in
this<br>
 wilderness--two days' drive from even a railway station--and at
the<br>
 mercy of Kossowski! But the next minute I reversed my
judgment.<br>
 Probably she adored her rufous lord, took his veneer of
courtesy--a<br>
 veneer of the most exquisite polish, I grant you, but
perilously<br>
 thin--for the very perfection of chivalry. Or perchance it was
his<br>
 inner savageness itself that charmed her; the most refined
women<br>
 often amaze one by the fascination which the preponderance of
the<br>
 brute in the opposite sex seems to have for them.</p>

<p>"I was anxious to hear more.</p>

<p>"'Is it not dull for the lady here at this time of the
year?'</p>

<p>"The valet raised his shoulders with a gesture of despair that
was<br>
 almost passionate.</p>

<p>"Dull! Ah, monsieur could not conceive to himself the dullness
of<br>
 it. That poor Madame la Baronne! not even a little child to
keep<br>
 her company on the long, long days when there was nothing but
snow<br>
 in the heaven and on the earth and the howling of the wind and
the<br>
 dogs to cheer her. At the beginning, indeed, it had been<br>
 different; when the master first brought home his bride the
house<br>
 was gay enough. It was all redecorated and refurnished to
receive<br>
 her (monsieur should have seen it before, a mere
rendezvous-de-<br>
 chasse--for the matter of that so were all the country houses
in<br>
 these parts). Ah, that was the good time! There were visits
month<br>
 after month; parties, sleighing, dancing, trips to St.
Petersburg<br>
 and Vienna. But this year it seemed they were to have nothing
but<br>
 boars and wolves. How madame could stand it--well, it was not
for<br>
 him to speak--and heaving a deep sigh he delicately inserted
my<br>
 white tie round my collar, and with a flourish twisted it into
an<br>
 irreproachable bow beneath my chin. I did not think it right
to<br>
 cross-examine the willing talker any further, especially as,<br>
 despite his last asseveration, there were evidently volumes
he<br>
 still wished to pour forth; but I confess that, as I made my
way<br>
 slowly out of my room along the noiseless length of passage, I
was<br>
 conscious of an unwonted, not to say vulgar, curiosity
concerning<br>
 the woman who had captivated such a man as the Baron
Kossowski.</p>

<p>"In a fit of speculative abstraction I must have taken the
wrong<br>
 turning, for I presently found myself in a long, narrow passage.
I<br>
 did not remember. I was retracing my steps when there came
the<br>
 sound of rapid footfalls upon stone flags; a little door flew
open<br>
 in the wall close to me, and a small, thick-set man, huddled in
the<br>
 rough sheepskin of the Galician peasant, with a mangy fur cap
on<br>
 his head, nearly ran headlong into my arms. I was about<br>
 condescendingly to interpellate him in my best Polish, when
I<br>
 caught the gleam of an angry yellow eye and noted the bristle of
a<br>
 red beard--Kossowski!</p>

<p>"Amazed, I fell back a step in silence. With a growl like
an<br>
 uncouth animal disturbed, he drew his filthy cap over his brow
with<br>
 a savage gesture and pursued his way down the corridor at a sort
of<br>
 wild-boar trot.</p>

<p>"This first meeting between host and guest was so odd, so<br>
 incongruous, that it afforded me plenty of food for a fresh line
of<br>
 conjecture as I traced my way back to the picture gallery, and
from<br>
 thence successfully to the drawing-room, which, as the door
was<br>
 ajar, I could not this time mistake.</p>

<p>"It was large and lofty and dimly lit by shaded lamps; through
the<br>
 rosy gloom I could at first only just make out a slender figure
by<br>
 the hearth; but as I advanced, this was resolved into a
singularly<br>
 graceful woman in clinging, fur-trimmed velvet gown, who, with
one<br>
 hand resting on the high mantelpiece, the other banging
listlessly<br>
 by her side, stood gazing down at the crumbling wood fire as if
in<br>
 a dream.</p>

<p>"My friends are kind enough to say that I have a catlike
tread; I<br>
 know not how that may be; at any rate the carpet I was walking
upon<br>
 was thick enough to smother a heavier footfall: not until I
was<br>
 quite close to her did my hostess become aware of my
presence.<br>
 Then she started violently and looked over her shoulder at me
with<br>
 dilating eyes. Evidently a nervous creature, I saw the pulse
in<br>
 her throat, strained by her attitude, flutter like a
terrified<br>
 bird.</p>

<p>"The next instant she had stretched out her hand with sweet
English<br>
 words of welcome, and the face, which I had been comparing in
my<br>
 mind to that of Guido's Cenci, became transformed by the arch
and<br>
 exquisite smile of a Greuse. For more than two years I had had
no<br>
 intercourse with any of my nationality. I could conceive the
sound<br>
 of his native tongue under such circumstances moving a man in
a<br>
 curious unexpected fashion.</p>

<p>"I babbled some commonplace reply, after which there was
silence<br>
 while we stood opposite each other, she looking at me
expectantly.<br>
 At length, with a sigh checked by a smile and an overtone of<br>
 sadness in a voice that yet tried to be sprightly:</p>

<p>"'Am I then so changed, Mr. Marshfield?' she asked. And all
at<br>
 once I knew her: the girl whose nightingale throat had redeemed
the<br>
 desolation of the evenings at Rathdrum, whose sunny beauty
had<br>
 seemed (even to my celebrated cold-blooded aestheticism) worthy
to<br>
 haunt a man's dreams. Yes, there was the subtle curve of the<br>
 waist, the warm line of throat, the dainty foot, the slender
tip-<br>
 tilted fingers--witty fingers, as I had classified them--which
I<br>
 now shook like a true Briton, instead of availing myself of
the<br>
 privilege the country gave me, and kissing her slender
wrist.</p>

<p>"But she was changed; and I told her so with
unconventional<br>
 frankness, studying her closely as I spoke.</p>

<p>"'I am afraid,' I said gravely, 'that this place does not
agree<br>
 with you.'</p>

<p>"She shrank from my scrutiny with a nervous movement and
flushed to<br>
 the roots of her red-brown hair. Then she answered coldly that
I<br>
 was wrong, that she was in excellent health, but that she could
not<br>
 expect any more than other people to preserve perennial youth
(I<br>
 rapidly calculated she might be two-and-twenty), though,
indeed,<br>
 with a little forced laugh, it was scarcely flattering to hear
one<br>
 had altered out of all recognition. Then, without allowing me
time<br>
 to reply, she plunged into a general topic of conversation
which,<br>
 as I should have been obtuse indeed not to take the hint, I did
my<br>
 best to keep up.</p>

<p><br>
 "But while she talked of Vienna and Warsaw, of her distant<br>
 neighbors, and last year's visitors, it was evident that her
mind<br>
 was elsewhere; her eye wandered, she lost the thread of her<br>
 discourse, answered me at random, and smiled her piteous
smile<br>
 incongruously.</p>

<p>"However lonely she might be in her solitary splendor, the
company<br>
 of a countryman was evidently no such welcome diversion.</p>

<p>"After a little while she seemed to feel herself that she
was<br>
 lacking in cordiality, and, bringing her absent gaze to bear
upon<br>
 me with a puzzled strained look: 'I fear you will find it
very<br>
 dull,' she said, 'my husband is so wrapped up this winter in
his<br>
 country life and his sport. You are the first visitor we have
had.<br>
 There is nothing but guns and horses here, and you do not care
for<br>
 these things.'</p>

<p>"The door creaked behind us; and the baron entered, in
faultless<br>
 evening dress. Before she turned toward him I was sharp enough
to<br>
 catch again the upleaping of a quick dread in her eyes, not even
so<br>
 much dread perhaps, I thought afterwards, as horror--the horror
we<br>
 notice in some animals at the nearing of a beast of prey. It
was<br>
 gone in a second, and she was smiling. But it was a
revelation.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he beat her in Russian fashion, and she, as an<br>
 Englishwoman, was narrow-minded enough to resent this; or
perhaps,<br>
 merely, I had the misfortune to arrive during a matrimonial<br>
 misunderstanding.</p>

<p>"The baron would not give me leisure to reflect; he was so
very<br>
 effusive in his greeting--not a hint of our previous
meeting--<br>
 unlike my hostess, all in all to me; eager to listen, to
reply;<br>
 almost affectionate, full of references to old times and
genial<br>
 allusions. No doubt when he chose he could be the most charming
of<br>
 men; there were moments when, looking at him in his quiet smile
and<br>
 restrained gesture, the almost exaggerated politeness of his
manner<br>
 to his wife, whose fingers he had kissed with pretty,
old-fashioned<br>
 gallantry upon his entrance, I asked myself, Could that
encounter<br>
 in the passage have been a dream? Could that savage in the<br>
 sheepskin be my courteous entertainer?</p>

<p>"'Just as I came in, did I hear my wife say there was nothing
for<br>
 you to do in this place?' he said presently to me. Then,
turning<br>
 to her:</p>

<p>"'You do not seem to know Mr. Marshfield. Wherever he can
open<br>
 his eyes there is for him something to see which might not
interest<br>
 other men. He will find things in my library which I have no<br>
 notion of. He will discover objects for scientific observation
in<br>
 all the members of my household, not only in the
good-looking<br>
 maids--though he could, I have no doubt, tell their points as
I<br>
 could those of a horse. We have maidens here of several
distinct<br>
 races, Marshfield. We have also witches, and Jew leeches, and
holy<br>
 daft people. In any case, Yany, with all its dependencies,<br>
 material, male and female, are at your disposal, for what you
can<br>
 make out of them.</p>

<p>"'It is good,' he went on gayly, 'that you should happen to
have<br>
 this happy disposition, for I fear that, no later than
to-morrow, I<br>
 may have to absent myself from home. I have heard that there
are<br>
 news of wolves--they threaten to be a greater pest than usual
this<br>
 winter, but I am going to drive them on quite a new plan, and
it<br>
 will go hard with me if I don't come even with them. Well for
you,<br>
 by the way, Marshfield, that you did not pass within their
scent<br>
 today.' Then, musingly: 'I should not give much for the life of
a<br>
 traveler who happened to wander in these parts just now.' Here
he<br>
 interrupted himself hastily and went over to his wife, who had
sunk<br>
 back on her chair, livid, seemingly on the point of
swooning.</p>

<p>"His gaze was devouring; so might a man look at the woman
he<br>
 adored, in his anxiety.</p>

<p>"'What! faint, Violet, alarmed!' His voice was subdued, yet
there<br>
 was an unmistakable thrill of emotion in it.</p>

<p>"'Pshaw!' thought I to myself, 'the man is a model
husband.'</p>

<p>"She clinched her hands, and by sheer force of will seemed to
pull<br>
 herself together. These nervous women have often an
unexpected<br>
 fund of strength.</p>

<p>"'Come, that is well,' said the baron with a flickering smile;
'Mr.<br>
 Marshfield will think you but badly acclimatized to Poland if
a<br>
 little wolf scare can upset you. My dear wife is so
soft-hearted,'<br>
 he went on to me, 'that she is capable of making herself quite
ill<br>
 over the sad fate that might have, but has not, overcome you.
Or,<br>
 perhaps,' he added, in a still gentler voice, 'her fear is that
I<br>
 may expose myself to danger for the public weal.'</p>

<p>"She turned her head away, but I saw her set her teeth as if
to<br>
 choke a sob. The baron chuckled in his throat and seemed to<br>
 luxuriate in the pleasant thought.</p>

<p>"At this moment folding doors were thrown open, and supper
was<br>
 announced. I offered my arm, she rose and took it in
silence.<br>
 This silence she maintained during the first part of the
meal,<br>
 despite her husband's brilliant conversation and almost
uproarious<br>
 spirits. But by and by a bright color mounted to her cheeks
and<br>
 luster to her eyes. I suppose you will think me horribly<br>
 unpoetical if I add that she drank several glasses of champagne
one<br>
 after the other, a fact which perhaps may account for the
change.</p>

<p>"At any rate she spoke and laughed and looked lovely, and I
did not<br>
 wonder that the baron could hardly keep his eyes off her.
But<br>
 whether it was her wifely anxiety or not--it was evident her
mind<br>
 was not at ease through it all, and I fancied that her
brightness<br>
 was feverish, her merriment slightly hysterical.</p>

<p>"After supper--an exquisite one it was--we adjourned together,
in<br>
 foreign fashion, to the drawing-room; the baron threw himself
into<br>
 a chair and, somewhat with the air of a pasha, demanded music.
He<br>
 was flushed; the veins of his forehead were swollen and stood
out<br>
 like cords; the wine drunk at table was potent: even through
my<br>
 phlegmatic frame it ran hotly.</p>

<p>"She hesitated a moment or two, then docilely sat down to
the<br>
 piano. That she could sing I have already made clear: how
she<br>
 could sing, with what pathos, passion, as well as perfect art,
I<br>
 had never realized before.</p>

<p>"When the song was ended she remained for a while, with eyes
lost<br>
 in distance, very still, save for her quick breathing. It
was<br>
 clear she was moved by the music; indeed she must have thrown
her<br>
 whole soul into it.</p>

<p>"At first we, the audience, paid her the rare compliment
of<br>
 silence. Then the baron broke forth into loud applause.
'Brava,<br>
 brava! that was really said con amore. A delicious love
song,<br>
 delicious--but French! You must sing one of our Slav melodies
for<br>
 Marshfield before you allow us to go and smoke.'</p>

<p>"She started from her reverie with a flush, and after a
pause<br>
 struck slowly a few simple chords, then began one of those<br>
 strangely sweet, yet intensely pathetic Russian airs, which
give<br>
 one a curious revelation of the profound, endless melancholy<br>
 lurking in the national mind.</p>

<p>"'What do you think of it?' asked the baron of me when it
ceased.</p>

<p>"'What I have always thought of such music--it is that of
a<br>
 hopeless people; poetical, crushed, and resigned.'</p>

<p>"He gave a loud laugh. 'Hear the analyst, the
psychologue--why,<br>
 man, it is a love song! Is it possible that we, uncivilized,
are<br>
 truer realists than our hypercultured Western neighbors? Have
we<br>
 gone to the root of the matter, in our simple way?'</p>

<p>"The baroness got up abruptly. She looked white and spent;
there<br>
 were bister circles round her eyes.</p>

<p>"'I am tired,' she said, with dry lips. 'You will excuse me,
Mr.<br>
 Marshfield, I must really go to bed.'</p>

<p>"'Go to bed, go to bed,' cried her husband gayly. Then,
quoting in<br>
 Russian from the song she had just sung: 'Sleep, my little
soft<br>
 white dove: my little innocent tender lamb!' She hurried from
the<br>
 room. The baron laughed again, and, taking me familiarly by
the<br>
 arm, led me to his own set of apartments for the promised
smoke.<br>
 He ensconced me in an armchair, placed cigars of every
description<br>
 and a Turkish pipe ready to my hand, and a little table on
which<br>
 stood cut-glass flasks and beakers in tempting array.</p>

<p>"After I had selected my cigar with some precautions, I
glanced at<br>
 him over a careless remark, and was startled to see a sudden<br>
 alteration in his whole look and attitude.</p>

<p>"'You will forgive me, Marshfield,' he said, as he caught my
eye,<br>
 speaking with spasmodic politeness. 'It is more than probable
that<br>
 I shall have to set out upon this chase I spoke of to-night, and
I<br>
 must now go and change my clothes, that I may be ready to start
at<br>
 any moment. This is the hour when it is most likely these
hell<br>
 beasts are to be got at. You have all you want, I hope,'<br>
 interrupting an outbreak of ferocity by an effort after his
former<br>
 courtesy.</p>

<p>"It was curious to watch the man of the world struggling with
the<br>
 primitive man.</p>

<p>"'But, baron,' said I, 'I do not at all see the fun of
sticking at<br>
 home like this. You know my passion for witnessing everything
new,<br>
 strange, and outlandish. You will surely not refuse me such
an<br>
 opportunity for observation as a midnight wolf raid. I will do
my<br>
 best not to be in the way if you will take me with you.'</p>

<p>"At first it seemed as if he had some difficulty in realizing
the<br>
 drift of my words, he was so engrossed by some inner thought.
But<br>
 as I repeated them, he gave vent to a loud cachinnation.</p>

<p>"'By heaven! I like your spirit,' he exclaimed, clapping
me<br>
 strongly on the shoulder. 'Of course you shall come. You
shall,'<br>
 he repeated, 'and I promise you a sight, a hunt such as you
never<br>
 heard or dreamed of--you will be able to tell them in England
the<br>
 sort of thing we can do here in that line--such wolves are
rare<br>
 quarry,' he added, looking slyly at me, 'and I have a new plan
for<br>
 getting at them.'</p>

<p>"There was a long pause, and then there rose in the stillness
the<br>
 unearthly howling of the baron's hounds, a cheerful sound
which<br>
 only their owner's somewhat loud converse of the evening had
kept<br>
 from becoming excessively obtrusive.</p>

<p>"'Hark at them--the beauties!' cried he, showing his short,
strong<br>
 teeth, pointed like a dog's in a wide grin of anticipative
delight.<br>
 'They have been kept on pretty short commons, poor things!
They<br>
 are hungry. By the way, Marshfield, you can sit tight to a
horse,<br>
 I trust? If you were to roll off, you know, these splendid<br>
 fellows--they would chop you up in a second. They would chop
you<br>
 up,' he repeated unctuously, 'snap, crunch, gobble, and there
would<br>
 be an end of you!'</p>

<p>"'If I could not ride a decent horse without being thrown,'
I<br>
 retorted, a little stung by his manner, 'after my recent
three<br>
 months' torture with the Guard Cossacks, I should indeed be
a<br>
 hopeless subject. Do not think of frightening me from the
exploit,<br>
 but say frankly if my company would be displeasing.'</p>

<p>"'Tut!' he said, waving his hand impatiently, 'it is your
affair.<br>
 I have warned you. Go and get ready if you want to come.
Time<br>
 presses.'</p>

<p>"I was determined to be of the fray; my blood was up. I
have<br>
 hinted that the baron's Tokay had stirred it.</p>

<p>"I went to my room and hurriedly donned clothes more suitable
for<br>
 rough night work. My last care was to slip into my pockets a
brace<br>
 of double-barreled pistols which formed part of my traveling
kit.<br>
 When I returned I found the baron already booted and spurred;
this<br>
 without metaphor. He was stretched full length on the divan,
and<br>
 did not speak as I came in, or even look at me. Chewing an
unlit<br>
 cigar, with eyes fixed on the ceiling, he was evidently
following<br>
 some absorbing train of ideas.</p>

<p>"The silence was profound; time went by; it grew oppressive;
at<br>
 length, wearied out, I fell, over my chibouque, into a doze
filled<br>
 with puzzling visions, out of which I was awakened with a
start.<br>
 My companion had sprung up, very lightly, to his feet. In
his<br>
 throat was an odd, half-suppressed cry, grewsome to hear. He
stood<br>
 on tiptoe, with eyes fixed, as though looking through the wall,
and<br>
 I distinctly saw his ears point in the intensity of his
listening.</p>

<p>"After a moment, with hasty, noiseless energy, and without
the<br>
 slightest ceremony, he blew the lamps out, drew back the
heavy<br>
 curtains and threw the tall window wide open. A rush of icy
air,<br>
 and the bright rays of the moon--gibbous, I remember, in her
third<br>
 quarter--filled the room. Outside the mist had condensed, and
the<br>
 view was unrestricted over the white plains at the foot of
the<br>
 hill.</p>

<p>"The baron stood motionless in the open window, callous to the
cold<br>
 in which, after a minute, I could hardly keep my teeth from<br>
 chattering, his head bent forward, still listening. I
listened<br>
 too, with 'all my ears,' but could not catch a sound; indeed
the<br>
 silence over the great expanse of snow might have been
called<br>
 awful; even the dogs were mute.</p>

<p>"Presently, far, far away, came a faint tinkle of bells; so
faint,<br>
 at first, that I thought it was but fancy, then distincter. It
was<br>
 even more eerie than the silence, I thought, though I knew it
could<br>
 come but from some passing sleigh. All at once that ceased,
and<br>
 again my duller senses could perceive nothing, though I saw by
my<br>
 host's craning neck that he was more on the alert than ever.
But<br>
 at last I too heard once more, this time not bells, but as it
were<br>
 the tread of horses muffled by the snow, intermittent and dull,
yet<br>
 drawing nearer. And then in the inner silence of the great
house<br>
 it seemed to me I caught the noise of closing doors; but here
the<br>
 hounds, as if suddenly becoming alive to some disturbance,
raised<br>
 the same fearsome concert of yells and barks with which they
had<br>
 greeted my arrival, and listening became useless.</p>

<p>"I had risen to my feet. My host, turning from the window,
seized<br>
 my shoulder with a fierce grip, and bade me 'hold my noise'; for
a<br>
 second or two I stood motionless under his iron talons, then
he<br>
 released me with an exultant whisper: "Now for our chase!" and
made<br>
 for the door with a spring. Hastily gulping down a mouthful
of<br>
 arrack from one of the bottles on the table, I followed him,
and,<br>
 guided by the sound of his footsteps before me, groped my
way<br>
 through passages as black as Erebus.</p>

<p>"After a time, which seemed a long one, a small door was flung
open<br>
 in front, and I saw Kossowski glide into the moonlit courtyard
and<br>
 cross the square. When I too came out he was disappearing into
the<br>
 gaping darkness of the open stable door, and there I overtook
him.</p>

<p>"A man who seemed to have been sleeping in a corner jumped up
at<br>
 our entrance, and led out a horse ready saddled. In obedience to
a<br>
 gruff order from his master, as the latter mounted, he then
brought<br>
 forward another which he had evidently thought to ride himself
and<br>
 held the stirrup for me.</p>

<p>"We came delicately forth, and the Cossack hurriedly barred
the<br>
 great door behind us. I caught a glimpse of his worn, scarred
face<br>
 by the moonlight, as he peeped after us for a second before<br>
 shutting himself in; it was stricken with terror.</p>

<p>"The baron trotted briskly toward the kennels, from whence
there<br>
 was now issuing a truly infernal clangor, and, as my steed
followed<br>
 suit of his own accord, I could see how he proceeded dexterously
to<br>
 unbolt the gates without dismounting, while the beasts
within<br>
 dashed themselves against them and tore the ground in their fury
of<br>
 impatience.</p>

<p>"He smiled, as he swung back the barriers at last, and his<br>
 'beauties' came forth. Seven or eight monstrous brutes, hounds
of<br>
 a kind unknown to me: fulvous and sleek of coat, tall on
their<br>
 legs, square-headed, long-tailed, deep-chested; with terrible
jaws<br>
 slobbering in eagerness. They leaped around and up at us, much
to<br>
 our horses' distaste. Kossowski, still smiling, lashed at
them<br>
 unsparingly with his hunting whip, and they responded, not
with<br>
 yells of pain, but with snarls of fury.</p>

<p>"Managing his restless steed and his cruel whip with
consummate<br>
 ease, my host drove the unruly crew before him out of the<br>
 precincts, then halted and bent down from his saddle to
examine<br>
 some slight prints in the snow which led, not the way I had
come,<br>
 but toward what seemed another avenue. In a second or two
the<br>
 hounds were gathered round this spot, their great snake-like
tails<br>
 quivering, nose to earth, yelping with excitement. I had some
ado<br>
 to manage my horse, and my eyesight was far from being as keen
as<br>
 the baron's, but I had then no doubt he had come already upon
wolf<br>
 tracks, and I shuddered mentally, thinking of the sleigh
bells.</p>

<p>"Suddenly Kossowski raised himself from his strained
position;<br>
 under his low fur cap his face, with its fixed smile, looked<br>
 scarcely human in the white light: and then we broke into a
hand<br>
 canter just as the hounds dashed, in a compact body, along
the<br>
 trail.</p>

<p>"But we had not gone more than a few hundred yards before
they<br>
 began to falter, then straggled, stopped and ran back and
about<br>
 with dismal cries. It was clear to me they had lost the scent.
My<br>
 companion reined in his horse, and mine, luckily a
well-trained<br>
 brute, halted of himself.</p>

<p>"We had reached a bend in a broad avenue of firs and larches,
and<br>
 just where we stood, and where the hounds ever returned and
met<br>
 nose to nose in frantic conclave, the snow was trampled and
soiled,<br>
 and a little farther on planed in a great sweep, as if by a
turning<br>
 sleigh. Beyond was a double-furrowed track of skaits and
regular<br>
 hoof prints leading far away.</p>

<p>"Before I had time to reflect upon the bearing of this
unexpected<br>
 interruption, Kossowski, as if suddenly possessed by a devil,
fell<br>
 upon the hounds with his whip, flogging them upon the new
track,<br>
 uttering the while the most savage cries I have ever heard
issue<br>
 from human throat. The disappointed beasts were nothing loath
to<br>
 seize upon another trail; after a second of hesitation they
had<br>
 understood, and were off upon it at a tearing pace, we after
them<br>
 at the best speed of our horses.</p>

<p>"Some unformed idea that we were going to escort, or
rescue,<br>
 benighted travelers flickered dimly in my mind as I galloped<br>
 through the night air; but when I managed to approach my
companion<br>
 and called out to him for explanation, he only turned half
round<br>
 and grinned at me.</p>

<p>"Before us lay now the white plain, scintillating under the
high<br>
 moon's rays. That light is deceptive; I could be sure of
nothing<br>
 upon the wide expanse but of the dark, leaping figures of
the<br>
 hounds already spread out in a straggling line, some right
ahead,<br>
 others just in front of us. In a short time also the icy
wind,<br>
 cutting my face mercilessly as we increased our pace, well
nigh<br>
 blinded me with tears of cold.</p>

<p>"I can hardly realize how long this pursuit after an unseen
prey<br>
 lasted; I can only remember that I was getting rather faint
with<br>
 fatigue, and ignominiously held on to my pommel, when all of
a<br>
 sudden the black outline of a sleigh merged into sight in front
of<br>
 us.</p>

<p>"I rubbed my smarting eyes with my benumbed hand; we were
gaining<br>
 upon it second by second; two of those hell hounds of the
baron's<br>
 were already within a few leaps of it.</p>

<p>"Soon I was able to make out two figures, one standing up
and<br>
 urging the horses on with whip and voice, the other clinging to
the<br>
 back seat and looking toward us in an attitude of terror. A
great<br>
 fear crept into my half-frozen brain--were we not bringing
deadly<br>
 danger instead of help to these travelers? Great God! did
the<br>
 baron mean to use them as a bait for his new method of wolf<br>
 hunting?</p>

<p>"I would have turned upon Kossowski with a cry of
expostulation or<br>
 warning, but he, urging on his hounds as he galloped on
their<br>
 flank, howling and gesticulating like a veritable Hun, passed me
by<br>
 like a flash--and all at once I knew."</p>

<p>Marshfield paused for a moment and sent his pale smile round
upon<br>
 his listeners, who now showed no signs of sleepiness; he
knocked<br>
 the ash from his cigar, twisted the latter round in his mouth,
and<br>
 added dryly:</p>

<p>"And I confess it seemed to me a little strong even for a
baron in<br>
 the Carpathians. The travelers were our quarry. But the
reason<br>
 why the Lord of Yany had turned man-hunter I was yet to
learn.<br>
 Just then I had to direct my energies to frustrating his plans.
I<br>
 used my spurs mercilessly. While I drew up even with him I saw
the<br>
 two figures in the sleigh change places; he who had hitherto
driven<br>
 now faced back, while his companion took the reins; there was
the<br>
 pale blue sheen of a revolver barrel under the moonlight,
followed<br>
 by a yellow flash, and the nearest hound rolled over in the
snow.</p>

<p>"With an oath the baron twisted round in his saddle to call up
and<br>
 urge on the remainder. My horse had taken fright at the report
and<br>
 dashed irresistibly forward, bringing me at once almost level
with<br>
 the fugitives, and the next instant the revolver was turned<br>
 menacingly toward me. There was no time to explain; my pistol
was<br>
 already drawn, and as another of the brutes bounded up,
almost<br>
 under my horse's feet, I loosed it upon him. I must have let
off<br>
 both barrels at once, for the weapon flew out of my hand, but
the<br>
 hound's back was broken. I presume the traveler understood; at
any<br>
 rate, he did not fire at me.</p>

<p>"In moments of intense excitement like these, strangely
enough, the<br>
 mind is extraordinarily open to impressions. I shall never
forget<br>
 that man's countenance in the sledge, as he stood upright
and<br>
 defied us in his mortal danger; it was young, very handsome,
the<br>
 features not distorted, but set into a sort of desperate,
stony<br>
 calm, and I knew it, beyond all doubt, for that of an
Englishman.<br>
 And then I saw his companion--it was the baron's wife. And I<br>
 understood why the bells had been removed.</p>

<p>"It takes a long time to say this; it only required an instant
to<br>
 see it. The loud explosion of my pistol had hardly ceased to
ring<br>
 before the baron, with a fearful imprecation, was upon me.
First<br>
 he lashed at me with his whip as we tore along side by side,
and<br>
 then I saw him wind the reins round his off arm and bend over,
and<br>
 I felt his angry fingers close tightly on my right foot. The
next<br>
 instant I should have been lifted out of my saddle, but there
came<br>
 another shot from the sledge. The baron's horse plunged and<br>
 stumbled, and the baron, hanging on to my foot with a fierce
grip,<br>
 was wrenched from his seat. His horse, however, was up again<br>
 immediately, and I was released, and then I caught a
confused<br>
 glimpse of the frightened and wounded animal galloping wildly
away<br>
 to the right, leaving a black track of blood behind him in
the<br>
 snow, his master, entangled in the reins, running with
incredible<br>
 swiftness by his side and endeavoring to vault back into the<br>
 saddle.</p>

<p>"And now came to pass a terrible thing which, in his savage
plans,<br>
 my host had doubtless never anticipated.</p>

<p>"One of the hounds that had during this short check recovered
lost<br>
 ground, coming across this hot trail of blood, turned away from
his<br>
 course, and with a joyous yell darted after the running man.
In<br>
 another instant the remainder of the pack was upon the new
scent.</p>

<p>"As soon as I could stop my horse, I tried to turn him in
the<br>
 direction the new chase had taken, but just then, through the
night<br>
 air, over the receding sound of the horse's scamper and the
sobbing<br>
 of the pack in full cry, there came a long scream, and after
that a<br>
 sickening silence. And I knew that somewhere yonder, under
the<br>
 beautiful moonlight, the Baron Kossowski was being devoured by
his<br>
 starving dogs.</p>

<p>"I looked round, with the sweat on my face, vaguely, for some
human<br>
 being to share the horror of the moment, and I saw, gliding
away,<br>
 far away in the white distance, the black silhouette of the<br>
 sledge."</p>

<p>"Well?" said we, in divers tones of impatience, curiosity,
or<br>
 horror, according to our divers temperaments, as the speaker<br>
 uncrossed his legs and gazed at us in mild triumph, with all
the<br>
 air of having said his say, and satisfactorily proved his
point.</p>

<p>"Well," repeated he, "what more do you want to know? It
will<br>
 interest you but slightly, I am sure, to hear how I found my
way<br>
 back to the Hof; or how I told as much as I deemed prudent of
the<br>
 evening's grewsome work to the baron's servants, who, by the
way,<br>
 to my amazement, displayed the profoundest and most
unmistakable<br>
 sorrow at the tidings, and sallied forth (at their head the
Cossack<br>
 who had seen us depart) to seek for his remains. Excuse the<br>
 unpleasantness of the remark: I fear the dogs must have left
very<br>
 little of him, he had dieted them so carefully. However, since
it<br>
 was to have been a case of 'chop, crunch, and gobble,' as the
baron<br>
 had it, I preferred that that particular fate should have
overtaken<br>
 him rather than me--or, for that matter, either of those two<br>
 country people of ours in the sledge.</p>

<p>"Nor am I going to inflict upon you," continued Marshfield,
after<br>
 draining his glass, "a full account of my impressions when I
found<br>
 myself once more in that immense, deserted, and stricken house,
so<br>
 luxuriously prepared for the mistress who had fled from it; how
I<br>
 philosophized over all this, according to my wont; the
conjectures<br>
 I made as to the first acts of the drama; the untold sufferings
my<br>
 countrywoman must have endured from the moment her husband
first<br>
 grew jealous till she determined on this desperate step; as to
how<br>
 and when she had met her lover, how they communicated, and how
the<br>
 baron had discovered the intended flitting in time to concoct
his<br>
 characteristic revenge.</p>

<p>"One thing you may be sure of, I had no mind to remain at Yany
an<br>
 hour longer than necessary. I even contrived to get well clear
of<br>
 the neighborhood before the lady's absence was discovered.
Luckily<br>
 for me--or I might have been taxed with connivance, though
indeed<br>
 the simple household did not seem to know what suspicion was,
and<br>
 accepted my account with childlike credence--very typical, and
very<br>
 convenient to me at the same time."</p>

<p>"But how do you know," said one of us, "that the man was her
lover?<br>
 He might have been her brother or some other relative."</p>

<p>"That," said Marshfield, with his little flat laugh, "I happen
to<br>
 have ascertained--and, curiously enough, only a few weeks ago.
It<br>
 was at the play, between the acts, from my comfortable seat
(the<br>
 first row in the pit). I was looking leisurely round the
house<br>
 when I caught sight of a woman, in a box close by, whose head
was<br>
 turned from me, and who presented the somewhat unusual spectacle
of<br>
 a young neck and shoulders of the most exquisite
contour--and<br>
 perfectly gray hair; and not dull gray, but rather of a
pleasing<br>
 tint like frosted silver. This aroused my curiosity. I brought
my<br>
 glasses to a focus on her and waited patiently till she
turned<br>
 round. Then I recognized the Baroness Kassowski, and I no
longer<br>
 wondered at the young hair being white.</p>

<p><br>
 "Yet she looked placid and happy; strangely so, it seemed to
me,<br>
 under the sudden reviving in my memory of such scenes as I have
now<br>
 described. But presently I understood further: beside her,
in<br>
 close attendance, was the man of the sledge, a handsome fellow
with<br>
 much of a military air about him.</p>

<p>"During the course of the evening, as I watched, I saw a
friend of<br>
 mine come into the box, and at the end I slipped out into
the<br>
 passage to catch him as he came out.</p>

<p>"'Who is the woman with the white hair?' I asked. Then, in
the<br>
 fragmentary style approved of by ultra-fashionable young
men--this<br>
 earnest-languid mode of speech presents curious similarities in
all<br>
 languages--he told me: 'Most charming couple in
London--awfully<br>
 pretty, wasn't she?--he had been in the Guards--attache at
Vienna<br>
 once--they adored each other. White hair, devilish queer,
wasn't<br>
 it? Suited her, somehow. And then she had been married to a<br>
 Russian, or something, somewhere in the wilds, and their

himself,<br>
 "I think I had better let you find that out for yourselves, if
you<br>
 care."</p>

<h2>The Fowl in the Pot</h2>

<h4>An Episode Adapted from the Memoirs of Maximilian de Bethune,
Duke<br>
 of Sully</h4>

<p><br>
 What I am going to relate may seem to some merely to be curious
and<br>
 on a party with the diverting story of M. Boisrose, which I
have<br>
 set down in an earlier part of my memoirs. But among the
calumnies<br>
 of those who have never ceased to attack me since the death of
the<br>
 late king, the statement that I kept from his majesty things
which<br>
 should have reached his ears has always had a prominent
place,<br>
 though a thousand times refuted by my friends, and those who
from<br>
 an intimate acquaintance with events could judge how faithfully
I<br>
 labored to deserve the confidence with which my master honored
me.<br>
 Therefore, I take it in hand to show by an example, trifling
in<br>
 itself, the full knowledge of affairs which the king had, and
to<br>
 prove that in many matters, which were never permitted to
become<br>
 known to the idlers of the court, he took a personal share,
worthy<br>
 as much of Haroun as of Alexander.</p>

<p><br>
 It was my custom, before I entered upon those negotiations with
the<br>
 Prince of Conde which terminated in the recovery of the estate
of<br>
 Villebon, where I now principally reside, to spend a part of
the<br>
 autumn and winter at Rosny. On these occasions I was in the
habit<br>
 of leaving Paris with a considerable train of Swiss, pages,
valets,<br>
 and grooms, together with the maids of honor and waiting women
of<br>
 the duchess. We halted to take dinner at Poissy, and
generally<br>
 contrived to reach Rosny toward nightfall, so as to sup by
the<br>
 light of flambeaux in a manner enjoyable enough, though devoid
of<br>
 that state which I have ever maintained, and enjoined upon
my<br>
 children, as at once the privilege and burden of rank.</p>

<p>At the time of which I am speaking I had for my favorite
charger<br>
 the sorrel horse which the Duke of Mercoeur presented to me with
a<br>
 view to my good offices at the time of the king's entry into
Paris;<br>
 and which I honestly transferred to his majesty in accordance
with<br>
 a principle laid down in another place. The king insisted on<br>
 returning it to me, and for several years I rode it on these
annual<br>
 visits to Rosny. What was more remarkable was that on each
of<br>
 these occasions it cast a shoe about the middle of the
afternoon,<br>
 and always when we were within a short league of the village
of<br>
 Aubergenville. Though I never had with me less than half a
score<br>
 of led horses, I had such an affection for the sorrel that I<br>
 preferred to wait until it was shod, rather than accommodate
myself<br>
 to a nag of less easy paces; and would allow my household to<br>
 precede me, staying behind myself with at most a guard or two,
my<br>
 valet, and a page.</p>

<p>The forge at Aubergenville was kept by a smith of some skill,
a<br>
 cheerful fellow, whom I always remembered to reward, considering
my<br>
 own position rather than his services, with a gold livre. His
joy<br>
 at receiving what was to him the income of a year was great,
and<br>
 never failed to reimburse me; in addition to which I took
some<br>
 pleasure in unbending, and learning from this simple peasant
and<br>
 loyal man, what the taxpayers were saying of me and my
reforms--a<br>
 duty I always felt I owed to the king my master.</p>

<p>As a man of breeding it would ill become me to set down the
homely<br>
 truths I thus learned. The conversations of the vulgar are
little<br>
 suited to a nobleman's memoirs; but in this I distinguish
between<br>
 the Duke of Sully and the king's minister, and it is in the
latter<br>
 capacity that I relate what passed on these diverting
occasions.<br>
 "Ho, Simon," I would say, encouraging the poor man as he
came<br>
 bowing and trembling before me, "how goes it, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Badly," he would answer, "very badly until your lordship came
this<br>
 way."</p>

<p>"And how is that, little man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is the roads," he always replied, shaking his bald
head as<br>
 he began to set about his business. "The roads since your
lordship<br>
 became surveyor-general are so good that not one horse in a
hundred<br>
 casts a shoe; and then there are so few highwaymen now that not
one<br>
 robber's plates do I replace in a twelvemonth. There is where
it<br>
 is."</p>

<p>At this I was highly delighted.</p>

<p>"Still, since I began to pass this way times have not been so
bad<br>
 with you, Simon," I would answer.</p>

<p>Thereto he had one invariable reply.</p>

<p>"No; thanks to Ste. Genevieve and your lordship, whom we call
in<br>
 this village the poor man's friend, I have a fowl in the
pot."</p>

<p>This phrase so pleased me that I repeated it to the king.
It<br>
 tickled his fancy also, and for some years it was a very
common<br>
 remark of that good and great ruler, that he hoped to live to
see<br>
 every peasant with a fowl in his pot.</p>

<p>"But why," I remember I once asked this honest fellow--it was
on<br>
 the last occasion of the sorrel falling lame there--"do you
thank<br>
 Ste. Genevieve?"</p>

<p>"She is my patron saint," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then you are a Parisian?"</p>

<p>"Your lordship is always right."</p>

<p>"But does her saintship do you any good?" I asked
curiously.</p>

<p>"Certainly, by your lordship's leave. My wife prays to her and
she<br>
 loosens the nails in the sorrel's shoes."</p>

<p>"In fact she pays off an old grudge," I answered, "for there
was a<br>
 time when Paris liked me little; but hark ye, master smith, I
am<br>
 not sure that this is not an act of treason to conspire with
Madame<br>
 Genevieve against the comfort of the king's minister. What
think<br>
 you, you rascal; can you pass the justice elm without a
shiver?"</p>

<p>This threw the simple fellow into a great fear, which the
sight of<br>
 the livre of gold speedily converted into joy as stupendous.<br>
 Leaving him still staring at his fortune I rode away; but when
we<br>
 had gone some little distance, the aspect of his face, when
I<br>
 charged him with treason, or my own unassisted
discrimination<br>
 suggested a clew to the phenomenon.</p>

<p>"La Trape," I said to my valet--the same who was with me at
Cahors--<br>
 "what is the name of the innkeeper at Poissy, at whose house
we<br>
 are accustomed to dine?"</p>

<p>"Andrew, may it please your lordship."</p>

<p>"Andrew! I thought so!" I exclaimed, smiting my thigh. "Simon
and<br>
 Andrew his brother! Answer, knave, and, if you have permitted
me<br>
 to be robbed these many times, tremble for your ears. Is he
not<br>
 brother to the smith at Aubergenville who has just shod my
horse?"</p>

<p>La Trape professed to be ignorant on this point, but a groom
who<br>
 had stayed behind with me, having sought my permission to
speak,<br>
 said it was so, adding that Master Andrew had risen in the
world<br>
 through large dealings in hay, which he was wont to take daily
into<br>
 Paris and sell, and that he did not now acknowledge or see
anything<br>
 of his brother the smith, though it was believed that he
retained a<br>
 sneaking liking for him.</p>

<p>On receiving this confirmation of my suspicions, my vanity as
well<br>
 as my sense of justice led me to act with the promptitude which
I<br>
 have exhibited in greater emergencies. I rated La Trape for
his<br>
 carelessness of my interests in permitting this deception to
be<br>
 practiced on me; and the main body of my attendants being now
in<br>
 sight, I ordered him to take two Swiss and arrest both
brothers<br>
 without delay. It wanted yet three hours of sunset, and I
judged<br>
 that, by hard riding, they might reach Rosny with their
prisoners<br>
 before bedtime.</p>

<p>I spent some time while still on the road in considering
what<br>
 punishment I should inflict on the culprits; and finally laid
aside<br>
 the purpose I had at first conceived of putting them to
death--an<br>
 infliction they had richly deserved--in favor of a plan which
I<br>
 thought might offer me some amusement. For the execution of this
I<br>
 depended upon Maignan, my equerry, who was a man of lively<br>
 imagination, being the same who had of his own motion arranged
and<br>
 carried out the triumphal procession, in which I was borne to
Rosny<br>
 after the battle of Ivry. Before I sat down to supper I gave
him<br>
 his directions; and as I had expected, news was brought to me
while<br>
 I was at table that the prisoners had arrived.</p>

<p>Thereupon I informed the duchess and the company generally,
for, as<br>
 was usual, a number of my country neighbors had come to
compliment<br>
 me on my return, that there was some sport of a rare kind on
foot;<br>
 and we adjourned, Maignan, followed by four pages bearing
lights,<br>
 leading the way to that end of the terrace which abuts on
the<br>
 linden avenue. Here, a score of grooms holding torches aloft
had<br>
 been arranged in a circle so that the impromptu theater thus<br>
 formed, which Maignan had ordered with much taste, was as light
as<br>
 in the day. On a sloping bank at one end seats had been placed
for<br>
 those who had supped at my table, while the rest of the
company<br>
 found such places of vantage as they could; their number,
indeed,<br>
 amounting, with my household, to two hundred persons. In the<br>
 center of the open space a small forge fire had been kindled,
the<br>
 red glow of which added much to the strangeness of the scene;
and<br>
 on the anvil beside it were ranged a number of horses' and
donkeys'<br>
 shoes, with a full complement of the tools used by smiths.
All<br>
 being ready I gave the word to bring in the prisoners, and
escorted<br>
 by La Trape and six of my guards, they were marched into the
arena.<br>
 In their pale and terrified faces, and the shaking limbs
which<br>
 could scarce support them to their appointed stations, I read
both<br>
 the consciousness of guilt and the apprehension of immediate
death;<br>
 it was plain that they expected nothing less. I was very
willing<br>
 to play with their fears, and for some time looked at them
in<br>
 silence, while all wondered with lively curiosity what would
ensue.<br>
 I then addressed them gravely, telling the innkeeper that I
knew<br>
 well he had loosened each year a shoe of my horse, in order
that<br>
 his brother might profit by the job of replacing it; and went on
to<br>
 reprove the smith for the ingratitude which had led him to
return<br>
 my bounty by the conception of so knavish a trick.</p>

<p>Upon this they confessed their guilt, and flinging themselves
upon<br>
 their knees with many tears and prayers begged for mercy.
This,<br>
 after a decent interval, I permitted myself to grant. "Your
lives,<br>
 which are forfeited, shall be spared," I pronounced. "But
punished<br>
 you must be. I therefore ordain that Simon, the smith, at
once<br>
 fit, nail, and properly secure a pair of iron shoes to
Andrew's<br>
 heels, and that then Andrew, who by that time will have picked
up<br>
 something of the smith's art, do the same to Simon. So will
you<br>
 both learn to avoid such shoeing tricks for the future."</p>

<p>It may well be imagined that a judgment so whimsical, and so
justly<br>
 adapted to the offense, charmed all save the culprits; and in
a<br>
 hundred ways the pleasure of those present was evinced, to such
a<br>
 degree, indeed, that Maignan had some difficulty in
restoring<br>
 silence and gravity to the assemblage. This done, however,
Master<br>
 Andrew was taken in hand and his wooden shoes removed. The
tools<br>
 of his trade were placed before the smith, who cast glances
so<br>
 piteous, first at his brother's feet and then at the shoes on
the<br>
 anvil, as again gave rise to a prodigious amount of merriment,
my<br>
 pages in particular well-nigh forgetting my presence, and
rolling<br>
 about in a manner unpardonable at another time. However, I
rebuked<br>
 them sharply, and was about to order the sentence to be
carried<br>
 into effect, when the remembrance of the many pleasant
simplicities<br>
 which the smith had uttered to me, acting upon a natural<br>
 disposition to mercy, which the most calumnious of my enemies
have<br>
 never questioned, induced me to give the prisoners a chance
of<br>
 escape. "Listen," I said, "Simon and Andrew. Your sentence
has<br>
 been pronounced, and will certainly be executed unless you
can<br>
 avail yourself of the condition I now offer. You shall have
three<br>
 minutes; if in that time either of you can make a good joke,
he<br>
 shall go free. If not, let a man attend to the bellows, La
Trape!"</p>

<p>This added a fresh satisfaction to my neighbors, who were
well<br>
 assured now that I had not promised them a novel
entertainment<br>
 without good grounds; for the grimaces of the two knaves
thus<br>
 bidden to jest if they would save their skins, were so
diverting<br>
 they would have made a nun laugh. They looked at me with
their<br>
 eyes as wide as plates, and for the whole of the time of
grace<br>
 never a word could they utter save howls for mercy. "Simon,"
I<br>
 said gravely, when the time was up, "have you a joke? No.
Andrew,<br>
 my friend, have you a joke? No. Then--"</p>

<p>I was going on to order the sentence to be carried out, when
the<br>
 innkeeper flung himself again upon his knees, and cried out
loudly--<br>
 as much to my astonishment as to the regret of the bystanders,
who<br>
 were bent on seeing so strange a shoeing feat--"One word, my
lord;<br>
 I can give you no joke, but I can do a service, an eminent
service<br>
 to the king. I can disclose a conspiracy!"</p>

<p>I was somewhat taken aback by this sudden and public
announcement.<br>
 But I had been too long in the king's employment not to have<br>
 remarked how strangely things are brought to light. On hearing
the<br>
 man's words therefore--which were followed by a stricken
silence--I<br>
 looked sharply at the faces of such of those present as it
was<br>
 possible to suspect, but failed to observe any sign of confusion
or<br>
 dismay, or anything more particular than so abrupt a statement
was<br>
 calculated to produce. Doubting much whether the man was not<br>
 playing with me, I addressed him sternly, warning him to
beware,<br>
 lest in his anxiety to save his heels by falsely accusing
others,<br>
 he should lose his head. For that if his conspiracy should
prove<br>
 to be an invention of his own, I should certainly consider it
my<br>
 duty to hang him forthwith.</p>

<p>He heard me out, but nevertheless persisted in his story,
adding<br>
 desperately, "It is a plot, my lord, to assassinate you and
the<br>
 king on the same day."</p>

<p>This statement struck me a blow; for I had good reason to know
that<br>
 at that time the king had alienated many by his infatuation
for<br>
 Madame de Verneuil; while I had always to reckon firstly with
all<br>
 who hated him, and secondly with all whom my pursuit of his<br>
 interests injured, either in reality or appearance. I
therefore<br>
 immediately directed that the prisoners should be led in
close<br>
 custody to the chamber adjoining my private closet, and taking
the<br>
 precaution to call my guards about me, since I knew not what<br>
 attempt despair might not breed, I withdrew myself, making
such<br>
 apologies to the company as the nature of the case
permitted.</p>

<p>I ordered Simon the smith to be first brought to me, and in
the<br>
 presence of Maignan only, I severely examined him as to his<br>
 knowledge of any conspiracy. He denied, however, that he had
ever<br>
 heard of the matters referred to by his brother, and persisted
so<br>
 firmly in the denial that I was inclined to believe him. In
the<br>
 end he was taken out and Andrew was brought in. The
innkeeper's<br>
 demeanor was such as I have often observed in intriguers
brought<br>
 suddenly to book. He averred the existence of the conspiracy,
and<br>
 that its objects were those which he had stated. He also
offered<br>
 to give up his associates, but conditioned that he should do
this<br>
 in his own way; undertaking to conduct me and one other
person--but<br>
 no more, lest the alarm should be given--to a place in Paris on
the<br>
 following night, where we could hear the plotters state their
plans<br>
 and designs. In this way only, he urged, could proof positive
be<br>
 obtained.</p>

<p>I was much startled by this proposal, and inclined to think it
a<br>
 trap; but further consideration dispelled my fears. The
innkeeper<br>
 had held no parley with anyone save his guards and myself since
his<br>
 arrest, and could neither have warned his accomplices, nor<br>
 acquainted them with any design the execution of which
should<br>
 depend on his confession to me. I therefore accepted his
terms--<br>
 with a private reservation that I should have help at
hand--and<br>
 before daybreak next morning left Rosny, which I had only seen
by<br>
 torchlight, with my prisoner and a select body of Swiss. We<br>
 entered Paris in the afternoon in three parties, with as
little<br>
 parade as possible, and went straight to the Arsenal, whence,
as<br>
 soon as evening fell, I hurried with only two armed attendants
to<br>
 the Louvre.</p>

<p>A return so sudden and unexpected was as great a surprise to
the<br>
 court as to the king, and I was not slow to mark with an
inward<br>
 smile the discomposure which appeared very clearly, on the faces
of<br>
 several, as the crowd in the chamber fell back for me to
approach<br>
 my master. I was careful, however, to remember that this
might<br>
 arise from other causes than guilt. The king received me with
his<br>
 wonted affection; and divining at once that I must have
something<br>
 important to communicate, withdrew with me to the farther end
of<br>
 the chamber, where we were out of earshot of the court. I
there<br>
 related the story to his majesty, keeping back nothing.</p>

<p>He shook his head, saying merely: "The fish to escape the
frying<br>
 pan, grand master, will jump into the fire. And human nature,
save<br>
 in the case of you and me, who can trust one another, is
very<br>
 fishy."</p>

<p>I was touched by this gracious compliment, but not convinced.
"You<br>
 have not seen the man, sire," I said, "and I have had that<br>
 advantage."</p>

<p>"And believe him?"</p>

<p>"In part," I answered with caution. "So far at least as to
be<br>
 assured that he thinks to save his skin, which he will only do
if<br>
 he be telling the truth. May I beg you, sire," I added
hastily,<br>
 seeing the direction of his glance, "not to look so fixedly at
the<br>
 Duke of Epernon? He grows uneasy."</p>

<p>"Conscience makes--you know the rest."</p>

<p>"Nay, sire, with submission," I replied, "I will answer for
him; if<br>
 he be not driven by fear to do something reckless."</p>

<p>"Good! I take your warranty, Duke of Sully," the king said,
with<br>
 the easy grace which came so natural to him. "But now in
this<br>
 matter what would you have me do?"</p>

<p>"Double your guards, sire, for to-night--that is all. I
will<br>
 answer for the Bastile and the Arsenal; and holding these we
hold<br>
 Paris."</p>

<p>But thereupon I found that the king had come to a decision,
which I<br>
 felt it to be my duty to combat with all my influence. He
had<br>
 conceived the idea of being the one to accompany me to the<br>
 rendezvous. "I am tired of the dice," he complained, "and sick
of<br>
 tennis, at which I know everybody's strength. Madame de
Verneuil<br>
 is at Fontainebleau, the queen is unwell. Ah, Sully, I would
the<br>
 old days were back when we had Nerac for our Paris, and knew
the<br>
 saddle better than the armchair!"</p>

<p>"A king must think of his people," I reminded him.</p>

<p>"The fowl in the pot? To be sure. So I will--to-morrow,"
he<br>
 replied. And in the end he would be obeyed. I took my leave
of<br>
 him as if for the night, and retired, leaving him at play with
the<br>
 Duke of Epernon. But an hour later, toward eight o'clock,
his<br>
 majesty, who had made an excuse to withdraw to his closet, met
me<br>
 outside the eastern gate of the Louvre.</p>

<p>He was masked, and attended only by Coquet, his master of
the<br>
 household. I too wore a mask and was esquired by Maignan,
under<br>
 whose orders were four Swiss--whom I had chosen because they
were<br>
 unable to speak French--guarding the prisoner Andrew. I bade<br>
 Maignan follow the innkeeper's directions, and we proceeded in
two<br>
 parties through the streets on the left bank of the river, past
the<br>
 Chatelet and Bastile, until we reached an obscure street near
the<br>
 water, so narrow that the decrepit wooden houses shut out
well-nigh<br>
 all view of the sky. Here the prisoner halted and called upon
me<br>
 to fulfill the terms of my agreement. I bade Maignan therefore
to<br>
 keep with the Swiss at a distance of fifty paces, but to come
up<br>
 should I whistle or otherwise give the alarm; and myself with
the<br>
 king and Andrew proceeded onward in the deep shadow of the
houses.<br>
 I kept my hand on my pistol, which I had previously shown to
the<br>
 prisoner, intimating that on the first sign of treachery I
should<br>
 blow out his brains. However, despite precaution, I felt<br>
 uncomfortable to the last degree. I blamed myself severely
for<br>
 allowing the king to expose himself and the country to this<br>
 unnecessary danger; while the meanness of the locality, the
fetid<br>
 air, the darkness of the night, which was wet and tempestuous,
and<br>
 the uncertainty of the event lowered my spirits, and made
every<br>
 splash in the kennel and stumble on the reeking, slippery<br>
 pavements--matters over which the king grew merry--seem no
light<br>
 troubles to me.</p>

<p>Arriving at a house, which, if we might judge in the
darkness,<br>
 seemed to be of rather greater pretensions than its fellows,
our<br>
 guide stopped, and whispered to us to mount some steps to a
raised<br>
 wooden gallery, which intervened between the lane and the
doorway.<br>
 On this, besides the door, a couple of unglazed windows looked
out.<br>
 The shutter of one was ajar, and showed us a large, bare
room,<br>
 lighted by a couple of rushlights. Directing us to place
ourselves<br>
 close to this shutter, the innkeeper knocked at the door in
a<br>
 peculiar fashion, and almost immediately entered, going at
once<br>
 into the lighted room. Peering cautiously through the window
we<br>
 were surprised to find that the only person within, save the<br>
 newcomer, was a young woman, who, crouching over a smoldering
fire,<br>
 was crooning a lullaby while she attended to a large black
pot.</p>

<p>"Good evening, mistress!" said the innkeeper, advancing to the
fire<br>
 with a fair show of nonchalance.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Master Andrew," the girl replied, looking up
and<br>
 nodding, but showing no sign of surprise at his appearance.<br>
 "Martin is away, but he may return at any moment."</p>

<p>"Is he still of the same mind?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"And what of Sully? Is he to die then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They have decided he must," the girl answered gloomily. It
may be<br>
 believed that I listened with all my ears, while the king by
a<br>
 nudge in my side seemed to rally me on the destiny so coolly<br>
 arranged for me. "Martin says it is no good killing the
other<br>
 unless he goes too--they have been so long together. But it
vexes<br>
 me sadly, Master Andrew," she added with a sudden break in
her<br>
 voice. "Sadly it vexes me. I could not sleep last night for<br>
 thinking of it, and the risk Martin runs. And I shall sleep
less<br>
 when it is done."</p>

<p>"Pooh-pooh!" said that rascally innkeeper. "Think less about
it.<br>
 Things will grow worse and worse if they are let live. The
King<br>
 has done harm enough already. And he grows old besides."</p>

<p>"That is true!" said the girl. "And no doubt the sooner he is
put<br>
 out of the way the better. He is changed sadly. I do not say
a<br>
 word for him. Let him die. It is killing Sully that troubles
me--<br>
 that and the risk Martin runs."</p>

<p>At this I took the liberty of gently touching the king. He<br>
 answered by an amused grimace; then by a motion of his hand
he<br>
 enjoined silence. We stooped still farther forward so as better
to<br>
 command the room. The girl was rocking herself to and fro in<br>
 evident distress of mind. "If we killed the King," she
continued,<br>
 "Martin declares we should be no better off, as long as
Sully<br>
 lives. Both or neither, he says. But I do not know. I cannot<br>
 bear to think of it. It was a sad day when we brought
Epernon<br>
 here, Master Andrew; and one I fear we shall rue as long as
we<br>
 live."</p>

<p>It was now the king's turn to be moved. He grasped my wrist
so<br>
 forcibly that I restrained a cry with difficulty. "Epernon!"
he<br>
 whispered harshly in my ear. "They are Epernon's tools! Where
is<br>
 your guaranty now, Rosny?"</p>

<p>I confess that I trembled. I knew well that the king,
particular<br>
 in small courtesies, never forgot to call his servants by
their<br>
 correct titles, save in two cases; when he indicated by the
seeming<br>
 error, as once in Marshal Biron's affair, his intention to
promote<br>
 or degrade them; or when he was moved to the depths of his
nature<br>
 and fell into an old habit. I did not dare to reply, but
listened<br>
 greedily for more information.</p>

<p>"When is it to be done?" asked the innkeeper, sinking his
voice and<br>
 glancing round, as if he would call especial attention to
this.</p>

<p>"That depends upon Master la Riviere," the girl answered.
"To-<br>
 morrow night, I understand, if Master la Riviere can have the
stuff<br>
 ready."</p>

<p>I met the king's eyes. They shone fiercely in the faint
light,<br>
 which issuing from the window fell on him. Of all things he
hated<br>
 treachery most, and La Riviere was his first body physician, and
at<br>
 this very time, as I well knew, was treating him for a
slight<br>
 derangement which the king had brought upon himself by his<br>
 imprudence. This doctor had formerly been in the employment of
the<br>
 Bouillon family, who had surrendered his services to the
king.<br>
 Neither I nor his majesty had trusted the Duke of Bouillon for
the<br>
 last year past, so that we were not surprised by this hint that
he<br>
 was privy to the design.</p>

<p><br>
 Despite our anxiety not to miss a word, an approaching step
warned<br>
 us at this moment to draw back. More than once before we had
done<br>
 so to escape the notice of a wayfarer passing up and down.
But<br>
 this time I had a difficulty in inducing the king to adopt
the<br>
 precaution. Yet it was well that I succeeded, for the person
who<br>
 came stumbling along toward us did not pass, but, mounting
the<br>
 steps, walked by within touch of us and entered the house.</p>

<p>"The plot thickens," muttered the king. "Who is this?"</p>

<p>At the moment he asked I was racking my brain to remember. I
have<br>
 a good eye and a fair recollection for faces, and this was one
I<br>
 had seen several times. The features were so familiar that I<br>
 suspected the man of being a courtier in disguise, and I ran
over<br>
 the names of several persons whom I knew to be Bouillon's
secret<br>
 agents. But he was none of these, and obeying the king's
gesture,<br>
 I bent myself again to the task of listening.</p>

<p>The girl looked up on the man's entrance, but did not rise.
"You<br>
 are late, Martin," she said.</p>

<p>"A little," the newcomer answered. "How do you do, Master
Andrew?<br>
 What cheer? What, still vexing, mistress?" he added
contemptuously<br>
 to the girl. "You have too soft a heart for this business!"</p>

<p>She sighed, but made no answer.</p>

<p>"You have made up your mind to it, I hear?" said the
innkeeper.</p>

<p>"That is it. Needs must when the devil drives!" replied the
man<br>
 jauntily. He had a downcast, reckless, luckless air, yet in
his<br>
 face I thought I still saw traces of a better spirit.</p>

<p>"The devil in this case was Epernon," quoth Andrew.</p>

<p>"Aye, curse him! I would I had cut his dainty throat before
he<br>
 crossed my threshold," cried the desperado. "But there, it is
too<br>
 late to say that now. What has to be done, has to be done."</p>

<p>"How are you going about it? Poison, the mistress says."</p>

<p>"Yes; but if I had my way," the man growled fiercely, "I would
out<br>
 one of these nights and cut the dogs' throats in the
kennel!"</p>

<p>"You could never escape, Martin!" the girl cried, rising
in<br>
 excitement. "It would be hopeless. It would merely be
throwing<br>
 away your own life."</p>

<p>"Well, it is not to be done that way, so there is an end of
it,"<br>
 quoth the man wearily. "Give me my supper. The devil take
the<br>
 king and Sully too! He will soon have them."</p>

<p>On this Master Andrew rose, and I took his movement toward the
door<br>
 for a signal for us to retire. He came out at once, shutting
the<br>
 door behind him as he bade the pair within a loud good night.
He<br>
 found us standing in the street waiting for him and forthwith
fell<br>
 on his knees in the mud and looked up at me, the
perspiration<br>
 standing thick on his white face. "My lord," he cried hoarsely,
"I<br>
 have earned my pardon!"</p>

<p>"If you go on," I said encouragingly, "as you have begun, have
no<br>
 fear." Without more ado I whistled up the Swiss and bade
Maignan<br>
 go with them and arrest the man and woman with as little<br>
 disturbance as possible. While this was being done we waited<br>
 without, keeping a sharp eye upon the informer, whose terror,
I<br>
 noted with suspicion, seemed to be in no degree diminished. He
did<br>
 not, however, try to escape, and Maignan presently came to tell
us<br>
 that he had executed the arrest without difficulty or
resistance.</p>

<p>The importance of arriving at the truth before Epernon and
the<br>
 greater conspirators should take the alarm was so vividly
present<br>
 to the minds of the king and myself, that we did not hesitate
to<br>
 examine the prisoners in their house, rather than hazard the
delay<br>
 and observation which their removal to a more fit place must<br>
 occasion. Accordingly, taking the precaution to post Coquet in
the<br>
 street outside, and to plant a burly Swiss in the doorway, the
king<br>
 and I entered. I removed my mask as I did so, being aware of
the<br>
 necessity of gaining the prisoners' confidence, but I begged
the<br>
 king to retain his. As I had expected, the man immediately<br>
 recognized me and fell on his knees, a nearer view confirming
the<br>
 notion I had previously entertained that his features were
familiar<br>
 to me, though I could not remember his name. I thought this a
good<br>
 starting-point for my examination, and bidding Maignan withdraw,
I<br>
 assumed an air of mildness and asked the fellow his name.</p>

<p>"Martin, only, please your lordship," he answered; adding,
"once I<br>
 sold you two dogs, sir, for the chase, and to your lady a
lapdog<br>
 called Ninette no larger than her hand."</p>

<p>I remembered the knave, then, as a fashionable dog dealer, who
had<br>
 been much about the court in the reign of Henry the Third
and<br>
 later; and I saw at once how convenient a tool he might be
made,<br>
 since he could be seen in converse with people of all ranks
without<br>
 arousing suspicion. The man's face as he spoke expressed so
much<br>
 fear and surprise that I determined to try what I had often
found<br>
 successful in the case of greater criminals, to squeeze him for
a<br>
 confession while still excited by his arrest, and before he
should<br>
 have had time to consider what his chances of support at the
hands<br>
 of his confederates might be. I charged him therefore solemnly
to<br>
 tell the whole truth as he hoped for the king's mercy. He
heard<br>
 me, gazing at me piteously; but his only answer, to my
surprise,<br>
 was that he had nothing to confess.</p>

<p>"Come, come," I replied sternly, "this will avail you nothing;
if<br>
 you do not speak quickly, rogue, and to the point, we shall
find<br>
 means to compel you. Who counseled you to attempt his
majesty's<br>
 life?"</p>

<p>On this he stared so stupidly at me, and exclaimed with so
real an<br>
 appearance of horror: "How? I attempt the king's life? God<br>
 forbid!" that I doubted that we had before us a more
dangerous<br>
 rascal than I had thought, and I hastened to bring him to
the<br>
 point.</p>

<p>"What, then," I cried, frowning, "of the stuff Master la
Riviere is<br>
 to give you to take the king's life to-morrow night? Oh, we
know<br>
 something, I assure you; bethink you quickly, and find your
tongue<br>
 if you would have an easy death."</p>

<p>I expected to see his self-control break down at this proof of
our<br>
 knowledge of his design, but he only stared at me with the
same<br>
 look of bewilderment. I was about to bid them bring in the<br>
 informer that I might see the two front to front, when the
female<br>
 prisoner, who had hitherto stood beside her companion in
such<br>
 distress and terror as might be expected in a woman of that
class,<br>
 suddenly stopped her tears and lamentations. It occurred to
me<br>
 that she might make a better witness. I turned to her, but when
I<br>
 would have questioned her she broke into a wild scream of<br>
 hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>From that I remember that I learned nothing, though it
greatly<br>
 annoyed me. But there was one present who did--the king. He
laid<br>
 his hand on my shoulder, gripping it with a force that I read as
a<br>
 command to be silent.</p>

<p>"Where," he said to the man, "do you keep the King and Sully
and<br>
 Epernon, my friend?"</p>

<p>"The King and Sully--with the lordship's leave," said the
man<br>
 quickly, with a frightened glance at me--"are in the kennels at
the<br>
 back of the house, but it is not safe to go near them. The King
is<br>
 raving mad, and--and the other dog is sickening. Epernon we had
to<br>
 kill a month back. He brought the disease here, and I have
had<br>
 such losses through him as have nearly ruined me, please
your<br>
 lordship."</p>

<p>"Get up--get up, man!" cried the king, and tearing off his
mask he<br>
 stamped up and down the room, so torn by paroxysms of laughter
that<br>
 he choked himself when again and again he attempted to
speak.</p>

<p>I too now saw the mistake, but I could not at first see it in
the<br>
 same light. Commanding myself as well as I could, I ordered one
of<br>
 the Swiss to fetch in the innkeeper, but to admit no one
else.</p>

<p>The knave fell on his knees as soon as he saw me, his
cheeks<br>
 shaking like a jelly.</p>

<p>"Mercy, mercy!" was all he could say.</p>

<p>"You have dared to play with me?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"You bade me joke," he sobbed, "you bade me."</p>

<p>I was about to say that it would be his last joke in this
world--<br>
 for my anger was fully aroused--when the king intervened.</p>

<p>"Nay," he said, laying his hand softly on my shoulder. "It
has<br>
 been the most glorious jest. I would not have missed it for
a<br>
 kingdom. I command you, Sully, to forgive him."</p>

<p>Thereupon his majesty strictly charged the three that they
should<br>
 not on peril of their lives mention the circumstances to
anyone.<br>
 Nor to the best of my belief did they do so, being so
shrewdly<br>
 scared when they recognized the king that I verily think they
never<br>
 afterwards so much as spoke of the affair to one another. My<br>
 master further gave me on his own part his most gracious
promise<br>
 that he would not disclose the matter even to Madame de Verneuil
or<br>
 the queen, and upon these representations he induced me freely
to<br>
 forgive the innkeeper. So ended this conspiracy, on the
diverting<br>
 details of which I may seem to have dwelt longer than I should;
but<br>
 alas! in twenty-one years of power I investigated many, and
this<br>
 one only can I regard with satisfaction. The rest were so
many<br>
 warnings and predictions of the fate which, despite all my care
and<br>
 fidelity, was in store for the great and good master I
served.</p>

<h2>The Pavilion on the Links</h2>

<h3><br>
 I</h3>

<p><br>
 I was a great solitary when I was young. I made it my pride
to<br>
 keep aloof and suffice for my own entertainment; and I may say
that<br>
 I had neither friends nor acquaintances until I met that friend
who<br>
 became my wife and the mother of my children. With one man
only<br>
 was I on private terms; this was R. Northmour, Esquire, of
Graden<br>
 Easter, in Scotland. We had met at college; and though there
was<br>
 not much liking between us, nor even much intimacy, we were
so<br>
 nearly of a humor that we could associate with ease to both.<br>
 Misanthropes, we believed ourselves to be; but I have thought
since<br>
 that we were only sulky fellows. It was scarcely a
companionship,<br>
 but a coexistence in unsociability. Northmour's exceptional<br>
 violence of temper made it no easy affair for him to keep the
peace<br>
 with anyone but me; and as he respected my silent ways, and let
me<br>
 come and go as I pleased, I could tolerate his presence
without<br>
 concern. I think we called each other friends.</p>

<p><br>
 When Northmour took his degree and I decided to leave the<br>
 university without one, he invited me on a long visit to
Graden<br>
 Easter; and it was thus that I first became acquainted with
the<br>
 scene of my adventures. The mansion house of Graden stood in
a<br>
 bleak stretch of country some three miles from the shore of
the<br>
 German Ocean. It was as large as a barrack; and as it had
been<br>
 built of a soft stone, liable to consume in the eager air of
the<br>
 seaside, it was damp and draughty within and half ruinous
without.<br>
 It was impossible for two young men to lodge with comfort in
such a<br>
 dwelling. But there stood in the northern part of the estate, in
a<br>
 wilderness of links and blowing sand hills, and between a<br>
 plantation and the sea, a small pavilion or belvedere, of
modern<br>
 design, which was exactly suited to our wants; and in this<br>
 hermitage, speaking little, reading much, and rarely
associating<br>
 except at meals, Northmour and I spent four tempestuous
winter<br>
 months. I might have stayed longer; but one March night
there<br>
 sprung up between us a dispute, which rendered my departure<br>
 necessary. Northmour spoke hotly, I remember, and I suppose I
must<br>
 have made some tart rejoinder. He leaped from his chair and<br>
 grappled me; I had to fight, without exaggeration, for my life;
and<br>
 it was only with a great effort that I mastered him, for he
was<br>
 near as strong in body as myself, and seemed filled with the
devil.<br>
 The next morning, we met on our usual terms; but I judged it
more<br>
 delicate to withdraw; nor did he attempt to dissuade me.</p>

<p>It was nine years before I revisited the neighborhood. I
traveled<br>
 at that time with a tilt-cart, a tent, and a cooking stove,<br>
 tramping all day beside the wagon, and at night, whenever it
was<br>
 possible, gypsying in a cove of the hills, or by the side of
a<br>
 wood. I believe I visited in this manner most of the wild
and<br>
 desolate regions both in England and Scotland; and, as I had<br>
 neither friends nor relations, I was troubled with no<br>
 correspondence, and had nothing in the nature of
headquarters,<br>
 unless it was the office of my solicitors, from whom I drew
my<br>
 income twice a year. It was a life in which I delighted; and
I<br>
 fully thought to have grown old upon the march, and at last died
in<br>
 a ditch.</p>

<p>It was my whole business to find desolate corners, where I
could<br>
 camp without the fear of interruption; and hence, being in
another<br>
 part of the same shire, I bethought me suddenly of the Pavilion
on<br>
 the Links. No thoroughfare passed within three miles of it.
The<br>
 nearest town, and that was but a fisher village, was at a
distance<br>
 of six or seven. For ten miles of length, and from a depth
varying<br>
 from three miles to half a mile, this belt of barren country
lay<br>
 along the sea. The beach, which was the natural approach, was
full<br>
 of quicksands. Indeed I may say there is hardly a better place
of<br>
 concealment in the United Kingdom. I determined to pass a week
in<br>
 the Sea-Wood of Graden Easter, and making a long stage, reached
it<br>
 about sundown on a wild September day.</p>

<p>The country, I have said, was mixed sand hill and links,
LINKS<br>
 being a Scottish name for sand which has ceased drifting and
become<br>
 more or less solidly covered with turf. The pavilion stood on
an<br>
 even space: a little behind it, the wood began in a hedge of
elders<br>
 huddled together by the wind; in front, a few tumbled sand
hills<br>
 stood between it and the sea. An outcropping of rock had formed
a<br>
 bastion for the sand, so that there was here a promontory in
the<br>
 coast line between two shallow bays; and just beyond the tides,
the<br>
 rock again cropped out and formed an islet of small dimensions
but<br>
 strikingly designed. The quicksands were of great extent at
low<br>
 water, and had an infamous reputation in the country. Close
in<br>
 shore, between the islet and the promontory, it was said they
would<br>
 swallow a man in four minutes and a half; but there may have
been<br>
 little ground for this precision. The district was alive
with<br>
 rabbits, and haunted by gulls which made a continual piping
about<br>
 the pavilion. On summer days the outlook was bright and even<br>
 gladsome; but at sundown in September, with a high wind, and
a<br>
 heavy surf rolling in close along the links, the place told
of<br>
 nothing but dead mariners and sea disaster. A ship beating
to<br>
 windward on the horizon, and a huge truncheon of wreck half
buried<br>
 in the sands at my feet, completed the innuendo of the
scene.</p>

<p>The pavilion--it had been built by the last proprietor,
Northmour's<br>
 uncle, a silly and prodigal virtuoso--presented little signs
of<br>
 age. It was two stories in height, Italian in design,
surrounded<br>
 by a patch of garden in which nothing had prospered but a
few<br>
 coarse flowers; and looked, with its shuttered windows, not like
a<br>
 house that had been deserted, but like one that had never
been<br>
 tenanted by man. Northmour was plainly from home; whether,
as<br>
 usual, sulking in the cabin of his yacht, or in one of his
fitful<br>
 and extravagant appearances in the world of society, I had,
of<br>
 course, no means of guessing. The place had an air of
solitude<br>
 that daunted even a solitary like myself; the wind cried in
the<br>
 chimneys with a strange and wailing note; and it was with a
sense<br>
 of escape, as if I were going indoors, that I turned away
and,<br>
 driving my cart before me, entered the skirts of the wood.</p>

<p>The Sea-Wood of Graden had been planted to shelter the
cultivated<br>
 fields behind, and check the encroachments of the blowing sand.
As<br>
 you advanced into it from coastward, elders were succeeded by
other<br>
 hardy shrubs; but the timber was all stunted and bushy; it led
a<br>
 life of conflict; the trees were accustomed to swing there
all<br>
 night long in fierce winter tempests; and even in early spring,
the<br>
 leaves were already flying, and autumn was beginning, in
this<br>
 exposed plantation. Inland the ground rose into a little
hill,<br>
 which, along with the islet, served as a sailing mark for
seamen.<br>
 When the hill was open of the islet to the north, vessels must
bear<br>
 well to the eastward to clear Graden Ness and the Graden
Bullers.<br>
 In the lower ground, a streamlet ran among the trees, and,
being<br>
 dammed with dead leaves and clay of its own carrying, spread
out<br>
 every here and there, and lay in stagnant pools. One or two
ruined<br>
 cottages were dotted about the wood; and, according to
Northmour,<br>
 these were ecclesiastical foundations, and in their time had<br>
 sheltered pious hermits.</p>

<p>I found a den, or small hollow, where there was a spring of
pure<br>
 water; and there, clearing away the brambles, I pitched the
tent,<br>
 and made a fire to cook my supper. My horse I picketed farther
in<br>
 the wood where there was a patch of sward. The banks of the
den<br>
 not only concealed the light of my fire, but sheltered me from
the<br>
 wind, which was cold as well as high.</p>

<p>The life I was leading made me both hardy and frugal. I
never<br>
 drank but water, and rarely eat anything more costly than
oatmeal;<br>
 and I required so little sleep, that, although I rose with the
peep<br>
 of day, I would often lie long awake in the dark or starry
watches<br>
 of the night. Thus in Graden Sea-Wood, although I fell
thankfully<br>
 asleep by eight in the evening I was awake again before eleven
with<br>
 a full possession of my faculties, and no sense of drowsiness
or<br>
 fatigue. I rose and sat by the fire, watching the trees and
clouds<br>
 tumultuously tossing and fleeing overhead, and hearkening to
the<br>
 wind and the rollers along the shore; till at length, growing
weary<br>
 of inaction, I quitted the den, and strolled toward the borders
of<br>
 the wood. A young moon, buried in mist, gave a faint
illumination<br>
 to my steps; and the light grew brighter as I walked forth into
the<br>
 links. At the same moment, the wind, smelling salt of the
open<br>
 ocean and carrying particles of sand, struck me with its
full<br>
 force, so that I had to bow my head.</p>

<p>When I raised it again to look about me, I was aware of a
light in<br>
 the pavilion. It was not stationary; but passed from one window
to<br>
 another, as though some one were reviewing the different
apartments<br>
 with a lamp or candle. I watched it for some seconds in
great<br>
 surprise. When I had arrived in the afternoon the house had
been<br>
 plainly deserted; now it was as plainly occupied. It was my
first<br>
 idea that a gang of thieves might have broken in and be now<br>
 ransacking Northmour's cupboards, which were many and not
ill<br>
 supplied. But what should bring thieves at Graden Easter?
And,<br>
 again, all the shutters had been thrown open, and it would
have<br>
 been more in the character of such gentry to close them. I<br>
 dismissed the notion, and fell back upon another. Northmour<br>
 himself must have arrived, and was now airing and inspecting
the<br>
 pavilion.</p>

<p>I have said that there was no real affection between this man
and<br>
 me; but, had I loved him like a brother, I was then so much more
in<br>
 love with solitude that I should none the less have shunned
his<br>
 company. As it was, I turned and ran for it; and it was with<br>
 genuine satisfaction that I found myself safely back beside
the<br>
 fire. I had escaped an acquaintance; I should have one more
night<br>
 in comfort. In the morning, I might either slip away before<br>
 Northmour was abroad, or pay him as short a visit as I
chose.</p>

<p>But when morning came, I thought the situation so diverting
that I<br>
 forgot my shyness. Northmour was at my mercy; I arranged a
good<br>
 practical jest, though I knew well that my neighbor was not the
man<br>
 to jest with in security; and, chuckling beforehand over its<br>
 success, took my place among the elders at the edge of the
wood,<br>
 whence I could command the door of the pavilion. The shutters
were<br>
 all once more closed, which I remember thinking odd; and the
house,<br>
 with its white walls and green venetians, looked spruce and<br>
 habitable in the morning light. Hour after hour passed, and
still<br>
 no sign of Northmour. I knew him for a sluggard in the
morning;<br>
 but, as it drew on toward noon, I lost my patience. To say
the<br>
 truth, I had promised myself to break my fast in the pavilion,
and<br>
 hunger began to prick me sharply. It was a pity to let the<br>
 opportunity go by without some cause for mirth; but the
grosser<br>
 appetite prevailed, and I relinquished my jest with regret,
and<br>
 sallied from the wood.</p>

<p>The appearance of the house affected me, as I drew near;
with<br>
 disquietude. It seemed unchanged since last evening; and I
had<br>
 expected it, I scarce knew why, to wear some external signs
of<br>
 habitation. But no: the windows were all closely shuttered,
the<br>
 chimneys breathed no smoke, and the front door itself was
closely<br>
 padlocked. Northmour, therefore, had entered by the back; this
was<br>
 the natural, and indeed, the necessary conclusion; and you
may<br>
 judge of my surprise when, on turning the house, I found the
back<br>
 door similarly secured.</p>

<p>My mind at once reverted to the original theory of thieves;
and I<br>
 blamed myself sharply for my last night's inaction. I examined
all<br>
 the windows on the lower story, but none of them had been
tampered<br>
 with; I tried the padlocks, but they were both secure. It
thus<br>
 became a problem how the thieves, if thieves they were, had
managed<br>
 to enter the house. They must have got, I reasoned, upon the
roof<br>
 of the outhouse where Northmour used to keep his
photographic<br>
 battery; and from thence, either by the window of the study or
that<br>
 of my old bedroom, completed their burglarious entry.</p>

<p>I followed what I supposed was their example; and, getting on
the<br>
 roof, tried the shutters of each room. Both were secure; but I
was<br>
 not to be beaten; and, with a little force, one of them flew
open,<br>
 grazing, as it did so, the back of my hand. I remember, I put
the<br>
 wound to my mouth, and stood for perhaps half a minute licking
it<br>
 like a dog, and mechanically gazing behind me over the waste
links<br>
 and the sea; and, in that space of time, my eye made note of
a<br>
 large schooner yacht some miles to the north-east. Then I threw
up<br>
 the window and climbed in.</p>

<p>I went over the house, and nothing can express my
mystification.<br>
 There was no sign of disorder, but, on the contrary, the rooms
were<br>
 unusually clean and pleasant. I found fires laid, ready for<br>
 lighting; three bedrooms prepared with a luxury quite foreign
to<br>
 Northmour's habits, and with water in the ewers and the beds
turned<br>
 down; a table set for three in the dining-room; and an ample
supply<br>
 of cold meats, game, and vegetables on the pantry shelves.
There<br>
 were guests expected, that was plain; but why guests, when<br>
 Northmour hated society? And, above all, why was the house
thus<br>
 stealthily prepared at dead of night? and why were the
shutters<br>
 closed and the doors padlocked?</p>

<p>I effaced all traces of my visit, and came forth from the
window<br>
 feeling sobered and concerned.</p>

<p>The schooner yacht was still in the same place; and it flashed
for<br>
 a moment through my mind that this might be the Red Earl
bringing<br>
 the owner of the pavilion and his guests. But the vessel's
head<br>
 was set the other way.</p>

<h3><br>
 II</h3>

<p><br>
 I returned to the den to cook myself a meal, of which I stood
in<br>
 great need, as well as to care for my horse, whom I had
somewhat<br>
 neglected in the morning. From time to time I went down to
the<br>
 edge of the wood; but there was no change in the pavilion, and
not<br>
 a human creature was seen all day upon the links. The schooner
in<br>
 the offing was the one touch of life within my range of
vision.<br>
 She, apparently with no set object, stood off and on or lay
to,<br>
 hour after hour; but as the evening deepened, she drew
steadily<br>
 nearer. I became more convinced that she carried Northmour and
his<br>
 friends, and that they would probably come ashore after dark;
not<br>
 only because that was of a piece with the secrecy of the<br>
 preparations, but because the tide would not have flowed<br>
 sufficiently before eleven to cover Graden Floe and the other
sea<br>
 quags that fortified the shore against invaders.</p>

<p><br>
 All day the wind had been going down, and the sea along with
it;<br>
 but there was a return towards sunset of the heavy weather of
the<br>
 day before. The night set in pitch dark. The wind came off
the<br>
 sea in squalls, like the firing of a battery of cannon; now
and<br>
 then there was a flaw of rain, and the surf rolled heavier with
the<br>
 rising tide. I was down at my observatory among the elders, when
a<br>
 light was run up to the masthead of the schooner, and showed
she<br>
 was closer in than when I had last seen her by the dying
daylight.<br>
 I concluded that this must be a signal to Northmour's associates
on<br>
 shore; and, stepping forth into the links, looked around me
for<br>
 something in response.</p>

<p>A small footpath ran along the margin of the wood, and formed
the<br>
 most direct communication between the pavilion and the
mansion-<br>
 house; and, as I cast my eyes to that side, I saw a spark of
light,<br>
 not a quarter of a mile away, and rapidly approaching. From
its<br>
 uneven course it appeared to be the light of a lantern carried
by a<br>
 person who followed the windings of the path, and was often<br>
 staggered and taken aback by the more violent squalls. I
concealed<br>
 myself once more among the elders, and waited eagerly for
the<br>
 newcomer's advance. It proved to be a woman; and, as she
passed<br>
 within half a rod of my ambush, I was able to recognise the<br>
 features. The deaf and silent old dame, who had nursed
Northmour<br>
 in his childhood, was his associate in this underhand
affair.</p>

<p>I followed her at a little distance, taking advantage of
the<br>
 innumerable heights and hollows, concealed by the darkness,
and<br>
 favored not only by the nurse's deafness, but by the uproar of
the<br>
 wind and surf. She entered the pavilion, and, going at once to
the<br>
 upper story, opened and set a light in one of the windows
that<br>
 looked toward the sea. Immediately afterwards the light at
the<br>
 schooner's masthead was run down and extinguished. Its purpose
had<br>
 been attained, and those on board were sure that they were<br>
 expected. The old woman resumed her preparations; although
the<br>
 other shutters remained closed, I could see a glimmer going to
and<br>
 fro about the house; and a gush of sparks from one chimney
after<br>
 another soon told me that the fires were being kindled.</p>

<p>Northmour and his guests, I was now persuaded, would come
ashore as<br>
 soon as there was water on the floe. It was a wild night for
boat<br>
 service; and I felt some alarm mingle with my curiosity as I<br>
 reflected on the danger of the landing. My old acquaintance,
it<br>
 was true, was the most eccentric of men; but the present<br>
 eccentricity was both disquieting and lugubrious to consider.
A<br>
 variety of feelings thus led me toward the beach, where I lay
flat<br>
 on my face in a hollow within six feet of the track that led to
the<br>
 pavilion. Thence, I should have the satisfaction of
recognizing<br>
 the arrivals, and, if they should prove to be acquaintances,<br>
 greeting them as soon as they landed.</p>

<p>Some time before eleven, while the tide was still dangerously
low,<br>
 a boat's lantern appeared close in shore; and, my attention
being<br>
 thus awakened, I could perceive another still far to
seaward,<br>
 violently tossed, and sometimes hidden by the billows. The<br>
 weather, which was getting dirtier as the night went on, and
the<br>
 perilous situation of the yacht upon a lee shore, had
probably<br>
 driven them to attempt a landing at the earliest possible
moment.</p>

<p>A little afterwards, four yachtsmen carrying a very heavy
chest,<br>
 and guided by a fifth with a lantern, passed close in front of
me<br>
 as I lay, and were admitted to the pavilion by the nurse.
They<br>
 returned to the beach, and passed me a third time with
another<br>
 chest, larger but apparently not so heavy as the first. A
third<br>
 time they made the transit; and on this occasion one of the<br>
 yachtsmen carried a leather portmanteau, and the others a
lady's<br>
 trunk and carriage bag. My curiosity was sharply excited. If
a<br>
 woman were among the guests of Northmour, it would show a change
in<br>
 his habits, and an apostasy from his pet theories of life,
well<br>
 calculated to fill me with surprise. When he and I dwelt
there<br>
 together, the pavilion had been a temple of misogyny. And now,
one<br>
 of the detested sex was to be installed under its roof. I<br>
 remembered one or two particulars, a few notes of daintiness
and<br>
 almost of coquetry which had struck me the day before as I
surveyed<br>
 the preparations in the house; their purpose was now clear, and
I<br>
 thought myself dull not to have perceived it from the first.</p>

<p>While I was thus reflecting, a second lantern drew near me
from the<br>
 beach. It was carried by a yachtsman whom I had not yet seen,
and<br>
 who was conducting two other persons to the pavilion. These
two<br>
 persons were unquestionably the guests for whom the house was
made<br>
 ready; and, straining eye and ear, I set myself to watch them
as<br>
 they passed. One was an unusually tall man, in a traveling
hat<br>
 slouched over his eyes, and a highland cape closely buttoned
and<br>
 turned up so as to conceal his face. You could make out no more
of<br>
 him than that he was, as I have said, unusually tall, and
walked<br>
 feebly with a heavy stoop. By his side, and either clinging to
him<br>
 or giving him support--I could not make out which--was a
young,<br>
 tall, and slender figure of a woman. She was extremely pale;
but<br>
 in the light of the lantern her face was so marred by strong
and<br>
 changing shadows, that she might equally well have been as ugly
as<br>
 sin or as beautiful as I afterwards found her to be.</p>

<p>When they were just abreast of me, the girl made some remark
which<br>
 was drowned by the noise of the wind.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said her companion; and there was something in the
tone<br>
 with which the word was uttered that thrilled and rather shook
my<br>
 spirits. It seemed to breathe from a bosom laboring under
the<br>
 deadliest terror; I have never heard another syllable so<br>
 expressive; and I still hear it again when I am feverish at
night,<br>
 and my mind runs upon old times. The man turned toward the girl
as<br>
 he spoke; I had a glimpse of much red beard and a nose which
seemed<br>
 to have been broken in youth; and his light eyes seemed shining
in<br>
 his face with some strong and unpleasant emotion.</p>

<p>But these two passed on and were admitted in their turn to
the<br>
 pavilion.</p>

<p>One by one, or in groups, the seamen returned to the beach.
The<br>
 wind brought me the sound of a rough voice crying, "Shove
off!"<br>
 Then, after a pause, another lantern drew near. It was
Northmour<br>
 alone.</p>

<p>My wife and I, a man and a woman, have often agreed to wonder
how a<br>
 person could be, at the same time, so handsome and so repulsive
as<br>
 Northmour. He had the appearance of a finished gentleman; his
face<br>
 bore every mark of intelligence and courage; but you had only
to<br>
 look at him, even in his most amiable moment, to see that he
had<br>
 the temper of a slaver captain. I never knew a character that
was<br>
 both explosive and revengeful to the same degree; he combined
the<br>
 vivacity of the south with the sustained and deadly hatreds of
the<br>
 north; and both traits were plainly written on his face, which
was<br>
 a sort of danger signal. In person, he was tall, strong, and<br>
 active; his hair and complexion very dark; his features
handsomely<br>
 designed, but spoiled by a menacing expression.</p>

<p>At that moment he was somewhat paler than by nature; he wore
a<br>
 heavy frown; and his lips worked, and he looked sharply round
him<br>
 as he walked, like a man besieged with apprehensions. And yet
I<br>
 thought he had a look of triumph underlying all, as though he
had<br>
 already done much, and was near the end of an achievement.</p>

<p>Partly from a scruple of delicacy--which I dare say came too
late--<br>
 partly from the pleasure of startling an acquaintance, I desired
to<br>
 make my presence known to him without delay.</p>

<p>I got suddenly to my feet, and stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Northmour!" said I.</p>

<p>I have never had so shocking a surprise in all my days. He
leaped<br>
 on me without a word; something shone in his hand; and he
struck<br>
 for my heart with a dagger. At the same moment I knocked him
head<br>
 over heels. Whether it was my quickness, or his own uncertainty,
I<br>
 know not; but the blade only grazed my shoulder, while the hilt
and<br>
 his fist struck me violently on the mouth.</p>

<p>I fled, but not far. I had often and often observed the<br>
 capabilities of the sand hills for protracted ambush or
stealthy<br>
 advances and retreats; and, not ten yards from the scene of
the<br>
 scuffle, plumped down again upon the grass. The lantern had
fallen<br>
 and gone out. But what was my astonishment to see Northmour
slip<br>
 at a bound into the pavilion, and hear him bar the door behind
him<br>
 with a clang of iron!</p>

<p>He had not pursued me. He had run away. Northmour, whom I
knew<br>
 for the most implacable and daring of men, had run away! I
could<br>
 scarce believe my reason; and yet in this strange business,
where<br>
 all was incredible, there was nothing to make a work about in
an<br>
 incredibility more or less. For why was the pavilion
secretly<br>
 prepared? Why had Northmour landed with his guests at dead
of<br>
 night, in half a gale of wind, and with the floe scarce
covered?<br>
 Why had he sought to kill me? Had he not recognized my voice?
I<br>
 wondered. And, above all, how had he come to have a dagger
ready<br>
 in his hand? A dagger, or even a sharp knife, seemed out of<br>
 keeping with the age in which we lived; and a gentleman
landing<br>
 from his yacht on the shore of his own estate, even although it
was<br>
 at night and with some mysterious circumstances, does not
usually,<br>
 as a matter of fact, walk thus prepared for deadly onslaught.
The<br>
 more I reflected, the further I felt at sea. I recapitulated
the<br>
 elements of mystery, counting them on my fingers: the
pavilion<br>
 secretly prepared for guests; the guests landed at the risk
of<br>
 their lives and to the imminent peril of the yacht; the guests,
or<br>
 at least one of them, in undisguised and seemingly causeless<br>
 terror; Northmour with a naked weapon; Northmour stabbing his
most<br>
 intimate acquaintance at a word; last, and not least
strange,<br>
 Northmour fleeing from the man whom he had sought to murder,
and<br>
 barricading himself, like a hunted creature, behind the door of
the<br>
 pavilion. Here were at least six separate causes for extreme<br>
 surprise; each part and parcel with the others, and forming
all<br>
 together one consistent story. I felt almost ashamed to believe
my<br>
 own senses.</p>

<p>As I thus stood, transfixed with wonder, I began to grow
painfully<br>
 conscious of the injuries I had received in the scuffle;
skulked<br>
 round among the sand hills; and, by a devious path, regained
the<br>
 shelter of the wood. On the way, the old nurse passed again
within<br>
 several yards of me, still carrying her lantern, on the
return<br>
 journey to the mansion house of Graden. This made a seventh<br>
 suspicious feature in the case. Northmour and his guests, it<br>
 appeared, were to cook and do the cleaning for themselves,
while<br>
 the old woman continued to inhabit the big empty barrack among
the<br>
 policies. There must surely be great cause for secrecy, when
so<br>
 many inconveniences were confronted to preserve it.</p>

<p>So thinking, I made my way to the den. For greater security,
I<br>
 trod out the embers of the fire, and lighted my lantern to
examine<br>
 the wound upon my shoulder. It was a trifling hurt, although
it<br>
 bled somewhat freely, and I dressed it as well as I could (for
its<br>
 position made it difficult to reach) with some rag and cold
water<br>
 from the spring. While I was thus busied, I mentally declared
war<br>
 against Northmour and his mystery. I am not an angry man by<br>
 nature, and I believe there was more curiosity than resentment
in<br>
 my heart. But war I certainly declared; and, by way of<br>
 preparation, I got out my revolver, and, having drawn the
charges,<br>
 cleaned and reloaded it with scrupulous care. Next I became<br>
 preoccupied about my horse. It might break loose, or fall to<br>
 neighing, and so betray my camp in the Sea-Wood. I determined
to<br>
 rid myself of its neighborhood; and long before dawn I was
leading<br>
 it over the links in the direction of the fisher village.</p>

<h3><br>
 III</h3>

<p><br>
 For two days I skulked round the pavilion, profiting by the
uneven<br>
 surface of the links. I became an adept in the necessary
tactics.<br>
 These low hillocks and shallow dells, running one into
another,<br>
 became a kind of cloak of darkness for my inthralling, but
perhaps<br>
 dishonorable, pursuit.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of this advantage, I could learn but little
of<br>
 Northmour or his guests.</p>

<p>Fresh provisions were brought under cover of darkness by the
old<br>
 woman from the mansion house. Northmour, and the young lady,<br>
 sometimes together, but more often singly, would walk for an
hour<br>
 or two at a time on the beach beside the quicksand. I could
not<br>
 but conclude that this promenade was chosen with an eye to
secrecy;<br>
 for the spot was open only to seaward. But it suited me not
less<br>
 excellently; the highest and most accidented of the sand
hills<br>
 immediately adjoined; and from these, lying flat in a hollow,
I<br>
 could overlook Northmour or the young lady as they walked.</p>

<p><br>
 The tall man seemed to have disappeared. Not only did he
never<br>
 cross the threshold, but he never so much as showed face at
a<br>
 window; or, at least, not so far as I could see; for I dared
not<br>
 creep forward beyond a certain distance in the day, since the
upper<br>
 floors commanded the bottoms of the links; and at night, when
I<br>
 could venture further, the lower windows were barricaded as if
to<br>
 stand a siege. Sometimes I thought the tall man must be
confined<br>
 to bed, for I remembered the feebleness of his gait; and
sometimes<br>
 I thought he must have gone clear away, and that Northmour and
the<br>
 young lady remained alone together in the pavilion. The idea,
even<br>
 then, displeased me.</p>

<p>Whether or not this pair were man and wife, I had seen
abundant<br>
 reason to doubt the friendliness of their relation. Although
I<br>
 could hear nothing of what they said, and rarely so much as
glean a<br>
 decided expression on the face of either, there was a
distance,<br>
 almost a stiffness, in their bearing which showed them to be
either<br>
 unfamiliar or at enmity. The girl walked faster when she was
with<br>
 Northmour than when she was alone; and I conceived that any<br>
 inclination between a man and a woman would rather delay
than<br>
 accelerate the step. Moreover, she kept a good yard free of
him,<br>
 and trailed her umbrella, as if it were a barrier, on the
side<br>
 between them. Northmour kept sidling closer; and, as the
girl<br>
 retired from his advance, their course lay at a sort of
diagonal<br>
 across the beach, and would have landed them in the surf had
it<br>
 been long enough continued. But, when this was imminent, the
girl<br>
 would unostentatiously change sides and put Northmour between
her<br>
 and the sea. I watched these maneuvers, for my part, with
high<br>
 enjoyment and approval, and chuckled to myself at every
move.</p>

<p>On the morning of the third day, she walked alone for some
time,<br>
 and I perceived, to my great concern, that she was more than
once<br>
 in tears. You will see that my heart was already interested
more<br>
 than I supposed. She had a firm yet airy motion of the body,
and<br>
 carried her head with unimaginable grace; every step was a thing
to<br>
 look at, and she seemed in my eyes to breathe sweetness and<br>
 distinction.</p>

<p>The day was so agreeable, being calm and sunshiny, with a
tranquil<br>
 sea, and yet with a healthful piquancy and vigor in the air,
that,<br>
 contrary to custom, she was tempted forth a second time to
walk.<br>
 On this occasion she was accompanied by Northmour, and they
had<br>
 been but a short while on the beach, when I saw him take
forcible<br>
 possession of her hand. She struggled, and uttered a cry that
was<br>
 almost a scream. I sprung to my feet, unmindful of my
strange<br>
 position; but, ere I had taken a step, I saw Northmour
bareheaded<br>
 and bowing very low, as if to apologize; and dropped again at
once<br>
 into my ambush. A few words were interchanged; and then,
with<br>
 another bow, he left the beach to return to the pavilion. He<br>
 passed not far from me, and I could see him, flushed and
lowering,<br>
 and cutting savagely with his cane among the grass. It was
not<br>
 without satisfaction that I recognized my own handiwork in a
great<br>
 cut under his right eye, and a considerable discoloration round
the<br>
 socket.</p>

<p>For some time the girl remained where he had left her, looking
out<br>
 past the islet and over the bright sea. Then with a start, as
one<br>
 who throws off preoccupation and puts energy again upon its
mettle,<br>
 she broke into a rapid and decisive walk. She also was much<br>
 incensed by what had passed. She had forgotten where she was.
And<br>
 I beheld her walk straight into the borders of the quicksand
where<br>
 it is most abrupt and dangerous. Two or three steps farther
and<br>
 her life would have been in serious jeopardy, when I slid down
the<br>
 face of the sand hill, which is there precipitous, and,
running<br>
 halfway forward, called to her to stop.</p>

<p>She did so, and turned round. There was not a tremor of fear
in<br>
 her behavior, and she marched directly up to me like a queen.
I<br>
 was barefoot, and clad like a common sailor, save for an
Egyptian<br>
 scarf round my waist; and she probably took me at first for
some<br>
 one from the fisher village, straying after bait. As for her,
when<br>
 I thus saw her face to face, her eyes set steadily and
imperiously<br>
 upon mine, I was filled with admiration and astonishment,
and<br>
 thought her even more beautiful than I had looked to find her.
Nor<br>
 could I think enough of one who, acting with so much boldness,
yet<br>
 preserved a maidenly air that was both quaint and engaging; for
my<br>
 wife kept an old-fashioned precision of manner through all
her<br>
 admirable life--an excellent thing in woman, since it sets
another<br>
 value on her sweet familiarities.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You were walking," I told her, "directly into Graden
Floe."</p>

<p>"You do not belong to these parts," she said again. "You
speak<br>
 like an educated man."</p>

<p>"I believe I have a right to that name," said I, "although in
this<br>
 disguise."</p>

<p>But her woman's eye had already detected the sash.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said; "your sash betrays you."</p>

<p>"You have said the word BETRAY," I resumed. "May I ask you not
to<br>
 betray me? I was obliged to disclose myself in your interest;
but<br>
 if Northmour learned my presence it might be worse than<br>
 disagreeable for me."</p>

<p>"Do you know," she asked, "to whom you are speaking?"</p>

<p>"Not to Mr. Northmour's wife?" I asked, by way of answer.</p>

<p>She shook her head. All this while she was studying my face
with<br>
 an embarrassing intentness. Then she broke out--</p>

<p>"You have an honest face. Be honest like your face, sir, and
tell<br>
 me what you want and what you are afraid of. Do you think I
could<br>
 hurt you? I believe you have far more power to injure me! And
yet<br>
 you do not look unkind. What do you mean--you, a
gentleman--by<br>
 skulking like a spy about this desolate place? Tell me," she
said,<br>
 "who is it you hate?"</p>

<p>"I hate no one," I answered; "and I fear no one face to face.
My<br>
 name is Cassilis--Frank Cassilis. I lead the life of a
vagabond<br>
 for my own good pleasure. I am one of Northmour's oldest
friends;<br>
 and three nights ago, when I addressed him on these links,
he<br>
 stabbed me in the shoulder with a knife."</p>

<p>"It was you!" she said.</p>

<p>"Why he did so," I continued, disregarding the interruption,
"is<br>
 more than I can guess, and more than I care to know. I have
not<br>
 many friends, nor am I very susceptible to friendship; but no
man<br>
 shall drive me from a place by terror. I had camped in the
Graden<br>
 Sea-Wood ere he came; I camp in it still. If you think I mean
harm<br>
 to you or yours, madame, the remedy is in your hand. Tell him
that<br>
 my camp is in the Hemlock Den, and tonight he can stab me in
safety<br>
 while I sleep."</p>

<p>With this I doffed my cap to her, and scrambled up once more
among<br>
 the sand hills. I do not know why, but I felt a prodigious
sense<br>
 of injustice, and felt like a hero and a martyr; while as a
matter<br>
 of fact, I had not a word to say in my defense, nor so much as
one<br>
 plausible reason to offer for my conduct. I had stayed at
Graden<br>
 out of a curiosity natural enough, but undignified; and
though<br>
 there was another motive growing in along with the first, it
was<br>
 not one which, at that period, I could have properly explained
to<br>
 the lady of my heart.</p>

<p>Certainly, that night, I thought of no one else; and, though
her<br>
 whole conduct and position seemed suspicious, I could not find
it<br>
 in my heart to entertain a doubt of her integrity. I could
have<br>
 staked my life that she was clear of blame, and, though all
was<br>
 dark at the present, that the explanation of the mystery would
show<br>
 her part in these events to be both right and needful. It
was<br>
 true, let me cudgel my imagination as I pleased, that I
could<br>
 invent no theory of her relations to Northmour; but I felt none
the<br>
 less sure of my conclusion because it was founded on instinct
in<br>
 place of reason, and, as I may say, went to sleep that night
with<br>
 the thought of her under my pillow.</p>

<p>Next day she came out about the same hour alone, and, as soon
as<br>
 the sand hills concealed her from the pavilion, drew nearer to
the<br>
 edge, and called me by name in guarded tones. I was astonished
to<br>
 observe that she was deadly pale, and seemingly under the
influence<br>
 of strong emotion.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cassilis!" she cried; "Mr. Cassilis!"</p>

<p>I appeared at once, and leaped down upon the beach. A
remarkable<br>
 air of relief overspread her countenance as soon as she saw
me.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, with a hoarse sound, like one whose bosom had
been<br>
 lightened of a weight. And then, "Thank God you are still
safe!"<br>
 she added; "I knew, if you were, you would be here." (Was not
this<br>
 strange? So swiftly and wisely does Nature prepare our hearts
for<br>
 these great lifelong intimacies, that both my wife and I had
been<br>
 given a presentiment on this the second day of our acquaintance.
I<br>
 had even then hoped that she would seek me; she had felt sure
that<br>
 she would find me.) "Do not," she went on swiftly, "do not stay
in<br>
 this place. Promise me that you will sleep no longer in that
wood.<br>
 You do not know how I suffer; all last night I could not sleep
for<br>
 thinking of your peril."</p>

<p>"Peril!" I repeated. "Peril from whom? From Northmour?"</p>

<p>"Not so," she said. "Did you think I would tell him after what
you<br>
 said?"</p>

<p>"Not from Northmour?" I repeated. "Then how? From whom? I
see<br>
 none to be afraid of."</p>

<p>"You must not ask me," was her reply, "for I am not free to
tell<br>
 you. Only believe me, and go hence--believe me, and go away<br>
 quickly, quickly, for your life!"</p>

<p>An appeal to his alarm is never a good plan to rid oneself of
a<br>
 spirited young man. My obstinacy was but increased by what
she<br>
 said, and I made it a point of honor to remain. And her
solicitude<br>
 for my safety still more confirmed me in the resolve.</p>

<p>"You must not think me inquisitive, madame," I replied; "but,
if<br>
 Graden is so dangerous a place, you yourself perhaps remain here
at<br>
 some risk."</p>

<p>She only looked at me reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You and your father--" I resumed; but she interrupted me
almost<br>
 with a gasp.</p>

<p>"My father! How do you know that?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I saw you together when you landed," was my answer; and I do
not<br>
 know why, but it seemed satisfactory to both of us, as indeed
it<br>
 was truth. "But," I continued, "you need have no fear from me.
I<br>
 see you have some reason to be secret, and, you may believe
me,<br>
 your secret is as safe with me as if I were in Graden Floe. I
have<br>
 scarce spoken to anyone for years; my horse is my only
companion,<br>
 and even he, poor beast, is not beside me. You see, then, you
may<br>
 count on me for silence. So tell me the truth, my dear young
lady,<br>
 are you not in danger?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Northmour says you are an honorable man," she returned,
"and I<br>
 believe it when I see you. I will tell you so much; you are
right;<br>
 we are in dreadful, dreadful danger, and you share it by
remaining<br>
 where you are."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I; "you have heard of me from Northmour? And he
gives<br>
 me a good character?"</p>

<p>"I asked him about you last night," was her reply. "I
pretended,"<br>
 she hesitated, "I pretended to have met you long ago, and spoken
to<br>
 you of him. It was not true; but I could not help myself
without<br>
 betraying you, and you had put me in a difficulty. He praised
you<br>
 highly."</p>

<p>"And--you may permit me one question--does this danger come
from<br>
 Northmour?" I asked.</p>

<p>"From Mr. Northmour?" she cried. "Oh, no, he stays with us
to<br>
 share it."</p>

<p>"While you propose that I should run away?" I said. "You do
not<br>
 rate me very high."</p>

<p>"Why should you stay?" she asked. "You are no friend of
ours."</p>

<p>I know not what came over me, for I had not been conscious of
a<br>
 similar weakness since I was a child, but I was so mortified
by<br>
 this retort that my eyes pricked and filled with tears, as I<br>
 continued to gaze upon her face.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, in a changed voice; "I did not mean the
words<br>
 unkindly."</p>

<p>"It was I who offended," I said; and I held out my hand with a
look<br>
 of appeal that somehow touched her, for she gave me hers at
once,<br>
 and even eagerly. I held it for awhile in mine, and gazed into
her<br>
 eyes. It was she who first tore her hand away, and, forgetting
all<br>
 about her request and the promise she had sought to extort, ran
at<br>
 the top of her speed, and without turning, till she was out
of<br>
 sight. And then I knew that I loved her, and thought in my
glad<br>
 heart that she--she herself--was not indifferent to my suit.
Many<br>
 a time she has denied it in after days, but it was with a
smiling<br>
 and not a serious denial. For my part, I am sure our hands
would<br>
 not have lain so closely in each other if she had not begun to
melt<br>
 to me already. And, when all is said, it is no great
contention,<br>
 since, by her own avowal, she began to love me on the
morrow.</p>

<p>And yet on the morrow very little took place. She came and
called<br>
 me down as on the day before, upbraided me for lingering at
Graden,<br>
 and, when she found I was still obdurate, began to ask me
more<br>
 particularly as to my arrival. I told her by what series of<br>
 accidents I had come to witness their disembarkation, and how I
had<br>
 determined to remain, partly from the interest which had
been<br>
 awakened in me by Northmour's guests, and partly because of his
own<br>
 murderous attack. As to the former, I fear I was disingenuous,
and<br>
 led her to regard herself as having been an attraction to me
from<br>
 the first moment that I saw her on the links. It relieves my
heart<br>
 to make this confession even now, when my wife is with God,
and<br>
 already knows all things, and the honesty of my purpose even
in<br>
 this; for while she lived, although it often pricked my
conscience,<br>
 I had never the hardihood to undeceive her. Even a little
secret,<br>
 in such a married life as ours, is like the rose leaf which
kept<br>
 the princess from her sleep.</p>

<p>From this the talk branched into other subjects, and I told
her<br>
 much about my lonely and wandering existence; she, for her
part,<br>
 giving ear, and saying little. Although we spoke very
naturally,<br>
 and latterly on topics that might seem indifferent, we were
both<br>
 sweetly agitated. Too soon it was time for her to go; and we<br>
 separated, as if by mutual consent, without shaking hands, for
both<br>
 knew that, between us, it was no idle ceremony.</p>

<p>The next, and that was the fourth day of our acquaintance, we
met<br>
 in the same spot, but early in the morning, with much
familiarity<br>
 and yet much timidity on either side. While she had once
more<br>
 spoken about my danger--and that, I understood, was her excuse
for<br>
 coming--I, who had prepared a great deal of talk during the
night,<br>
 began to tell her how highly I valued her kind interest, and how
no<br>
 one had ever cared to hear about my life, nor had I ever cared
to<br>
 relate it, before yesterday. Suddenly she interrupted me,
saying<br>
 with vehemence--</p>

<p>"And yet, if you knew who I was, you would not so much as
speak to<br>
 me!"</p>

<p>I told her such a thought was madness, and, little as we had
met, I<br>
 counted her already a dear friend; but my protestations seemed
only<br>
 to make her more desperate.</p>

<p>"My father is in hiding!" she cried.</p>

<p>"My dear," I said, forgetting for the first time to add
"young<br>
 lady," "what do I care? If I were in hiding twenty times
over,<br>
 would it make one thought of change in you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but the cause!" she cried, "the cause! It is"--she
faltered<br>
 for a second--"it is disgraceful to us!"</p>

<h3><br>
 IV</h3>

<p><br>
 This was my wife's story, as I drew it from her among tears
and<br>
 sobs. Her name was Clara Huddlestone: it sounded very beautiful
in<br>
 my ears; but not so beautiful as that other name of Clara
Cassilis,<br>
 which she wore during the longer and, I thank God, the
happier<br>
 portion of her life. Her father, Bernard Huddlestone, had been
a<br>
 private banker in a very large way of business. Many years
before,<br>
 his affairs becoming disordered, he had been led to try
dangerous,<br>
 and at last criminal, expedients to retrieve himself from
ruin.<br>
 All was in vain; he became more and more cruelly involved,
and<br>
 found his honor lost at the same moment with his fortune.
About<br>
 this period, Northmour had been courting his daughter with
great<br>
 assiduity, though with small encouragement; and to him, knowing
him<br>
 thus disposed in his favor, Bernard Huddlestone turned for help
in<br>
 his extremity. It was not merely ruin and dishonor, nor merely
a<br>
 legal condemnation, that the unhappy man had brought upon his
head.<br>
 It seems he could have gone to prison with a light heart. What
he<br>
 feared, what kept him awake at night or recalled him from
slumber<br>
 into frenzy, was some secret, sudden, and unlawful attempt upon
his<br>
 life. Hence, he desired to bury his existence and escape to one
of<br>
 the islands in the South Pacific, and it was in Northmour's
yacht,<br>
 the "Red Earl," that he designed to go. The yacht picked them
up<br>
 clandestinely upon the coast of Wales, and had once more
deposited<br>
 them at Graden, till she could be refitted and provisioned for
the<br>
 longer voyage. Nor could Clara doubt that her hand had been<br>
 stipulated as the price of passage. For, although Northmour
was<br>
 neither unkind, nor even discourteous, he had shown himself
in<br>
 several instances somewhat overbold in speech and manner.</p>

<p><br>
 I listened, I need not say, with fixed attention, and put
many<br>
 questions as to the more mysterious part. It was in vain. She
had<br>
 no clear idea of what the blow was, nor of how it was expected
to<br>
 fall. Her father's alarm was unfeigned and physically
prostrating,<br>
 and he had thought more than once of making an unconditional<br>
 surrender to the police. But the scheme was finally abandoned,
for<br>
 he was convinced that not even the strength of our English
prisons<br>
 could shelter him from his pursuers. He had had many affairs
in<br>
 Italy, and with Italians resident in London, in the latter years
of<br>
 his business; and these last, as Clara fancied, were somehow<br>
 connected with the doom that threatened him. He had shown
great<br>
 terror at the presence of an Italian seaman on board the
"Red<br>
 Earl," and had bitterly and repeatedly accused Northmour in<br>
 consequence. The latter had protested that Beppo (that was
the<br>
 seaman's name) was a capital fellow, and could be trusted to
the<br>
 death; but Mr. Huddlestone had continued ever since to declare
that<br>
 all was lost, that it was only a question of days, and that
Beppo<br>
 would be the ruin of him yet.</p>

<p>I regarded the whole story as the hallucination of a mind
shaken by<br>
 calamity. He had suffered heavy loss by his Italian
transactions;<br>
 and hence the sight of an Italian was hateful to him, and
the<br>
 principal part in his nightmare would naturally enough be played
by<br>
 one of that nation.</p>

<p>"What your father wants," I said, "is a good doctor and
some<br>
 calming medicine."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Northmour?" objected Clara. "He is untroubled by
losses,<br>
 and yet he shares in this terror."</p>

<p>I could not help laughing at what I considered her
simplicity.</p>

<p>"My dear," said I, "you have told me yourself what reward he
has to<br>
 look for. All is fair in love, you must remember; and if
Northmour<br>
 foments your father's terrors, it is not at all because he
is<br>
 afraid of any Italian man, but simply because he is infatuated
with<br>
 a charming English woman."</p>

<p>She reminded me of his attack upon myself on the night of
the<br>
 disembarkation, and this I was unable to explain. In short,
and<br>
 from one thing to another, it was agreed between us that I
should<br>
 set out at once for the fisher village, Graden Wester, as it
was<br>
 called, look up all the newspapers I could find, and see for
myself<br>
 if there seemed any basis of fact for these continued alarms.
The<br>
 next morning, at the same hour and place, I was to make my
report<br>
 to Clara. She said no more on that occasion about my
departure;<br>
 nor, indeed, did she make it a secret that she clung to the
thought<br>
 of my proximity as something helpful and pleasant; and, for
my<br>
 part, I could not have left her, if she had gone upon her knees
to<br>
 ask it.</p>

<p>I reached Graden Wester before ten in the forenoon; for in
those<br>
 days I was an excellent pedestrian, and the distance, as I think
I<br>
 have said, was little over seven miles; fine walking all the
way<br>
 upon the springy turf. The village is one of the bleakest on
that<br>
 coast, which is saying much: there is a church in the hollow;
a<br>
 miserable haven in the rocks, where many boats have been lost
as<br>
 they returned from fishing; two or three score of stone
houses<br>
 arranged along the beach and in two streets, one leading from
the<br>
 harbor, and another striking out from it at right angles; and,
at<br>
 the corner of these two, a very dark and cheerless tavern, by
way<br>
 of principal hotel.</p>

<p>I had dressed myself somewhat more suitably to my station in
life,<br>
 and at once called upon the minister in his little manse beside
the<br>
 graveyard. He knew me, although it was more than nine years
since<br>
 we had met; and when I told him that I had been long upon a
walking<br>
 tour, and was behind with the news, readily lent me an armful
of<br>
 newspapers, dating from a month back to the day before. With
these<br>
 I sought the tavern, and, ordering some breakfast, sat down
to<br>
 study the "Huddlestone Failure."</p>

<p>It had been, it appeared, a very flagrant case. Thousands
of<br>
 persons were reduced to poverty; and one in particular had
blown<br>
 out his brains as soon as payment was suspended. It was strange
to<br>
 myself that, while I read these details, I continued rather
to<br>
 sympathize with Mr. Huddlestone than with his victims; so
complete<br>
 already was the empire of my love for my wife. A price was<br>
 naturally set upon the banker's head; and, as the case was<br>
 inexcusable and the public indignation thoroughly aroused,
the<br>
 unusual figure of 750 pounds was offered for his capture. He
was<br>
 reported to have large sums of money in his possession. One
day,<br>
 he had been heard of in Spain; the next, there was sure<br>
 intelligence that he was still lurking between Manchester
and<br>
 Liverpool, or along the border of Wales; and the day after,
a<br>
 telegram would announce his arrival in Cuba or Yucatan. But in
all<br>
 this there was no word of an Italian, nor any sign of
mystery.</p>

<p>In the very last paper, however, there was one item not so
clear.<br>
 The accountants who were charged to verify the failure had,
it<br>
 seemed, come upon the traces of a very large number of
thousands,<br>
 which figured for some time in the transactions of the house
of<br>
 Huddlestone; but which came from nowhere, and disappeared in
the<br>
 same mysterious fashion. It was only once referred to by name,
and<br>
 then under the initials "X. X."; but it had plainly been
floated<br>
 for the first time into the business at a period of great<br>
 depression some six years ago. The name of a distinguished
royal<br>
 personage had been mentioned by rumor in connection with this
sum.<br>
 "The cowardly desperado"--such, I remember, was the
editorial<br>
 expression--was supposed to have escaped with a large part of
this<br>
 mysterious fund still in his possession.</p>

<p>I was still brooding over the fact, and trying to torture it
into<br>
 some connection with Mr. Huddlestone's danger, when a man
entered<br>
 the tavern and asked for some bread and cheese with a
decided<br>
 foreign accent.</p>

<p>"Siete Italiano?" said I.</p>

<p>"Si, Signor," was his reply.</p>

<p>I said it was unusually far north to find one of his
compatriots;<br>
 at which he shrugged his shoulders, and replied that a man would
go<br>
 anywhere to find work. What work he could hope to find at
Graden<br>
 Wester, I was totally unable to conceive; and the incident
struck<br>
 so unpleasantly upon my mind, that I asked the landlord, while
he<br>
 was counting me some change, whether he had ever before seen
an<br>
 Italian in the village. He said he had once seen some
Norwegians,<br>
 who had been shipwrecked on the other side of Graden Ness
and<br>
 rescued by the lifeboat from Cauldhaven.</p>

<p>"No!" said I; "but an Italian, like the man who has just had
bread<br>
 and cheese."</p>

<p>"What?" cried he, "yon black-avised fellow wi' the teeth? Was
he<br>
 an I-talian? Weel, yon's the first that ever I saw, an' I dare
say<br>
 he's like to be the last."</p>

<p>Even as he was speaking, I raised my eyes, and, casting a
glance<br>
 into the street, beheld three men in earnest conversation
together,<br>
 and not thirty yards away. One of them was my recent companion
in<br>
 the tavern parlor; the other two, by their handsome sallow
features<br>
 and soft hats, should evidently belong to the same race. A
crowd<br>
 of village children stood around them, gesticulating and
talking<br>
 gibberish in imitation. The trio looked singularly foreign to
the<br>
 bleak dirty street in which they were standing and the dark
gray<br>
 heaven that overspread them; and I confess my incredulity
received<br>
 at that moment a shock from which it never recovered. I
might<br>
 reason with myself as I pleased, but I could not argue down
the<br>
 effect of what I had seen, and I began to share in the
Italian<br>
 terror.</p>

<p>It was already drawing toward the close of the day before I
had<br>
 returned the newspapers to the manse, and got well forward on
to<br>
 the links on my way home. I shall never forget that walk. It
grew<br>
 very cold and boisterous; the wind sung in the short grass about
my<br>
 feet; thin rain showers came running on the gusts; and an
immense<br>
 mountain range of clouds began to arise out of the bosom of
the<br>
 sea. It would be hard to imagine a more dismal evening; and<br>
 whether it was from these external influences, or because my
nerves<br>
 were already affected by what I had heard and seen, my
thoughts<br>
 were as gloomy as the weather.</p>

<p>The upper windows of the pavilion commanded a considerable
spread<br>
 of links in the direction of Graden Wester. To avoid
observation,<br>
 it was necessary to hug the beach until I had gained cover from
the<br>
 higher sand hills on the little headland, when I might
strike<br>
 across, through the hollows, for the margin of the wood. The
sun<br>
 was about setting; the tide was low, and all the quicksands<br>
 uncovered; and I was moving along, lost in unpleasant thought,
when<br>
 I was suddenly thunderstruck to perceive the prints of human
feet.<br>
 They ran parallel to my own course, but low down upon the
beach,<br>
 instead of along the border of the turf; and, when I examined
them,<br>
 I saw at once, by the size and coarseness of the impression,
that<br>
 it was a stranger to me and to those of the pavilion who had<br>
 recently passed that way. Not only so; but from the
recklessness<br>
 of the course which he had followed, steering near to the
most<br>
 formidable portions of the sand, he was evidently a stranger to
the<br>
 country and to the ill-repute of Graden beach.</p>

<p>Step by step I followed the prints; until, a quarter of a
mile<br>
 farther, I beheld them die away into the southeastern boundary
of<br>
 Graden Floe. There, whoever he was, the miserable man had<br>
 perished. One or two gulls, who had, perhaps, seen him
disappear,<br>
 wheeled over his sepulcher with their usual melancholy piping.
The<br>
 sun had broken through the clouds by a last effort, and colored
the<br>
 wide level of quicksands with a dusky purple. I stood for
some<br>
 time gazing at the spot, chilled and disheartened by my own<br>
 reflections, and with a strong and commanding consciousness
of<br>
 death. I remember wondering how long the tragedy had taken,
and<br>
 whether his screams had been audible at the pavilion. And
then,<br>
 making a strong resolution, I was about to tear myself away,
when a<br>
 gust fiercer than usual fell upon this quarter of the beach, and
I<br>
 saw, now whirling high in air, now skimming lightly across
the<br>
 surface of the sands, a soft, black, felt hat, somewhat conical
in<br>
 shape, such as I had remarked already on the heads of the
Italians.</p>

<p>I believe, but I am not sure, that I uttered a cry. The wind
was<br>
 driving the hat shoreward, and I ran round the border of the
floe<br>
 to be ready against its arrival. The gust fell, dropping the
hat<br>
 for awhile upon the quicksand, and then, once more
freshening,<br>
 landed it a few yards from where I stood. I seized it with
the<br>
 interest you may imagine. It had seen some service; indeed, it
was<br>
 rustier than either of those I had seen that day upon the
street.<br>
 The lining was red, stamped with the name of the maker, which
I<br>
 have forgotten, and that of the place of manufacture,
Venedig.<br>
 This (it is not yet forgotten) was the name given by the
Austrians<br>
 to the beautiful city of Venice, then, and for long after, a
part<br>
 of their dominions.</p>

<p>The shock was complete. I saw imaginary Italians upon every
side;<br>
 and for the first, and, I may say, for the last time in my<br>
 experience, became overpowered by what is called a panic terror.
I<br>
 knew nothing, that is, to be afraid of, and yet I admit that I
was<br>
 heartily afraid; and it was with sensible reluctance that I<br>
 returned to my exposed and solitary camp in the Sea-Wood.</p>

<p>There I eat some cold porridge which had been left over from
the<br>
 night before, for I was disinclined to make a fire; and,
feeling<br>
 strengthened and reassured, dismissed all these fanciful
terrors<br>
 from my mind, and lay down to sleep with composure.</p>

<p>How long I may have slept it is impossible for me to guess;
but I<br>
 was awakened at last by a sudden, blinding flash of light into
my<br>
 face. It woke me like a blow. In an instant I was upon my
knees.<br>
 But the light had gone as suddenly as it came. The darkness
was<br>
 intense. And, as it was blowing great guns from the sea, and<br>
 pouring with rain, the noises of the storm effectually
concealed<br>
 all others.</p>

<p>It was, I dare say, half a minute before I regained my
self-<br>
 possession. But for two circumstances, I should have thought I
had<br>
 been awakened by some new and vivid form of nightmare. First,
the<br>
 flap of my tent, which I had shut carefully when I retired, was
now<br>
 unfastened; and, second, I could still perceive, with a
sharpness<br>
 that excluded any theory of hallucination, the smell of hot
metal<br>
 and of burning oil. The conclusion was obvious. I had been<br>
 awakened by some one flashing a bull's-eye lantern in my face.
It<br>
 had been but a flash, and away. He had seen my face, and
then<br>
 gone. I asked myself the object of so strange a proceeding,
and<br>
 the answer came pat. The man, whoever he was, had thought to<br>
 recognize me, and he had not. There was another question<br>
 unresolved; and to this, I may say, I feared to give an answer;
if<br>
 he had recognized me, what would he have done?</p>

<p>My fears were immediately diverted from myself, for I saw that
I<br>
 had been visited in a mistake; and I became persuaded that
some<br>
 dreadful danger threatened the pavilion. It required some nerve
to<br>
 issue forth into the black and intricate thicket which
surrounded<br>
 and overhung the den; but I groped my way to the links,
drenched<br>
 with rain, beaten upon and deafened by the gusts, and fearing
at<br>
 every step to lay my hand upon some lurking adversary. The<br>
 darkness was so complete that I might have been surrounded by
an<br>
 army and yet none the wiser, and the uproar of the gale so
loud<br>
 that my hearing was as useless as my sight.</p>

<p>For the rest of that night, which seemed interminably long,
I<br>
 patrolled the vicinity of the pavilion, without seeing a
living<br>
 creature or hearing any noise but the concert of the wind, the
sea,<br>
 and the rain. A light in the upper story filtered through a
cranny<br>
 of the shutter, and kept me company till the approach of
dawn.</p>

<h3><br>
 V</h3>

<p><br>
 With the first peep of day, I retired from the open to my old
lair<br>
 among the sand hills, there to await the coming of my wife.
The<br>
 morning was gray, wild, and melancholy; the wind moderated
before<br>
 sunrise, and then went about, and blew in puffs from the shore;
the<br>
 sea began to go down, but the rain still fell without mercy.
Over<br>
 all the wilderness of links there was not a creature to be
seen.<br>
 Yet I felt sure the neighborhood was alive with skulking foes.
The<br>
 light that had been so suddenly and surprisingly flashed upon
my<br>
 face as I lay sleeping, and the hat that had been blown ashore
by<br>
 the wind from over Graden Floe, were two speaking signals of
the<br>
 peril that environed Clara and the party in the pavilion.</p>

<p><br>
 It was, perhaps, half-past seven, or nearer eight, before I saw
the<br>
 door open, and that dear figure come toward me in the rain. I
was<br>
 waiting for her on the beach before she had crossed the sand
hills.</p>

<p>"I have had such trouble to come!" she cried. "They did not
wish<br>
 me to go walking in the rain."</p>

<p>"Clara," I said, "you are not frightened!"</p>

<p>"No," said she, with a simplicity that filled my heart
with<br>
 confidence. For my wife was the bravest as well as the best
of<br>
 women; in my experience, I have not found the two go always<br>
 together, but with her they did; and she combined the extreme
of<br>
 fortitude with the most endearing and beautiful virtues.</p>

<p>I told her what had happened; and, though her cheek grew
visibly<br>
 paler, she retained perfect control over her senses.</p>

<p>"You see now that I am safe," said I, in conclusion. "They do
not<br>
 mean to harm me; for, had they chosen, I was a dead man last<br>
 night."</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon my arm.</p>

<p>"And I had no presentiment!" she cried.</p>

<p>Her accent thrilled me with delight. I put my arm about her,
and<br>
 strained her to my side; and, before either of us was aware,
her<br>
 hands were on my shoulders and my lips upon her mouth. Yet up
to<br>
 that moment no word of love had passed between us. To this day
I<br>
 remember the touch of her cheek, which was wet and cold with
the<br>
 rain; and many a time since, when she has been washing her face,
I<br>
 have kissed it again for the sake of that morning on the
beach.<br>
 Now that she is taken from me, and I finish my pilgrimage alone,
I<br>
 recall our old loving kindnesses and the deep honesty and
affection<br>
 which united us, and my present loss seems but a trifle in<br>
 comparison.</p>

<p>We may have thus stood for some seconds--for time passes
quickly<br>
 with lovers--before we were startled by a peal of laughter close
at<br>
 hand. It was not natural mirth, but seemed to be affected in
order<br>
 to conceal an angrier feeling. We both turned, though I still
kept<br>
 my left arm about Clara's waist; nor did she seek to
withdraw<br>
 herself; and there, a few paces off upon the beach, stood<br>
 Northmour, his head lowered, his hands behind his back, his<br>
 nostrils white with passion.</p>

<p>"Ah! Cassilis!" he said, as I disclosed my face.</p>

<p>"That same," said I; for I was not at all put about.</p>

<p>"And so, Miss Huddlestone," he continued slowly but savagely,
"this<br>
 is how you keep your faith to your father and to me? This is
the<br>
 value you set upon your father's life? And you are so
infatuated<br>
 with this young gentleman that you must brave ruin, and
decency,<br>
 and common human caution--"</p>

<p>"Miss Huddlestone--" I was beginning to interrupt him, when
he, in<br>
 his turn, cut in brutally--</p>

<p>"You hold your tongue," said he; "I am speaking to that
girl."</p>

<p>"That girl, as you call her, is my wife," said I; and my wife
only<br>
 leaned a little nearer, so that I knew she had affirmed my
words.</p>

<p>"Your what?" he cried. "You lie!"</p>

<p>"Northmour," I said, "we all know you have a bad temper, and I
am<br>
 the last man to be irritated by words. For all that, I
propose<br>
 that you speak lower, for I am convinced that we are not
alone."</p>

<p>He looked round him, and it was plain my remark had in some
degree<br>
 sobered his passion. "What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>I only said one word: "Italians."</p>

<p>He swore a round oath, and looked at us, from one to the
other.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cassilis knows all that I know," said my wife.</p>

<p>"What I want to know," he broke out, "is where the devil
Mr.<br>
 Cassilis comes from, and what the devil Mr. Cassilis is doing
here.<br>
 You say you are married; that I do not believe. If you were,<br>
 Graden Floe would soon divorce you; four minutes and a half,<br>
 Cassilis. I keep my private cemetery for my friends."</p>

<p>"It took somewhat longer," said I, "for that Italian."</p>

<p>He looked at me for a moment half daunted, and then,
almost<br>
 civilly, asked me to tell my story. "You have too much the<br>
 advantage of me, Cassilis," he added. I complied of course; and
he<br>
 listened, with several ejaculations, while I told him how I
had<br>
 come to Graden: that it was I whom he had tried to murder on
the<br>
 night of landing; and what I had subsequently seen and heard of
the<br>
 Italians.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, when I had done, "it is here at last; there
is no<br>
 mistake about that. And what, may I ask, do you propose to
do?"</p>

<p>"I propose to stay with you and lend a hand," said I.</p>

<p>"You are a brave man," he returned, with a peculiar
intonation.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," said I.</p>

<p>"And so," he continued, "I am to understand that you two
are<br>
 married? And you stand up to it before my face, Miss
Huddlestone?"</p>

<p>"We are not yet married," said Clara; "but we shall be as soon
as<br>
 we can."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Northmour. "And the bargain? D--n it, you're
not a<br>
 fool, young woman; I may call a spade a spade with you. How
about<br>
 the bargain? You know as well as I do what your father's
life<br>
 depends upon. I have only to put my hands under my coat tails
and<br>
 walk away, and his throat would be cut before the evening."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Northmour," returned Clara, with great spirit; "but
that<br>
 is what you will never do. You made a bargain that was unworthy
of<br>
 a gentleman; but you are a gentleman for all that, and you
will<br>
 never desert a man whom you have begun to help."</p>

<p>"Aha!" said he. "You think I will give my yacht for nothing?
You<br>
 think I will risk my life and liberty for love of the old<br>
 gentleman; and then, I suppose, he best man at the wedding, to
wind<br>
 up? Well," he added, with an odd smile, "perhaps you are not<br>
 altogether wrong. But ask Cassilis here. HE knows me. Am I a
man<br>
 to trust? Am I safe and scrupulous? Am I kind?"</p>

<p>"I know you talk a great deal, and sometimes, I think,
very<br>
 foolishly," replied Clara, "but I know you are a gentleman, and
I<br>
 am not the least afraid."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a peculiar approval and admiration;
then,<br>
 turning to me, "Do you think I would give her up without a<br>
 struggle, Frank?" said he. "I tell you plainly, you look out.
The<br>
 next time we come to blows--"</p>

<p>"Will make the third," I interrupted, smiling.</p>

<p>"Aye, true; so it will," he said. "I had forgotten. Well,
the<br>
 third time's lucky."</p>

<p>"The third time, you mean, you will have the crew of the 'Red
Earl'<br>
 to help," I said.</p>

<p>"Do you hear him?" he asked, turning to my wife.</p>

<p>"I hear two men speaking like cowards," said she. "I
should<br>
 despise myself either to think or speak like that. And neither
of<br>
 you believe one word that you are saying, which makes it the
more<br>
 wicked and silly."</p>

<p>"She's a trump!" cried Northmour. "But she's not yet Mrs.<br>
 Cassilis. I say no more. The present is not for me."</p>

<p>Then my wife surprised me.</p>

<p>"I leave you here," she said suddenly. "My father has been
too<br>
 long alone. But remember this: you are to be friends, for you
are<br>
 both good friends to me."</p>

<p>She has since told me her reason for this step. As long as
she<br>
 remained, she declares that we two would have continued to
quarrel;<br>
 and I suppose that she was right, for when she was gone we fell
at<br>
 once into a sort of confidentiality.</p>

<p>Northmour stared after her as she went away over the sand
hill.</p>

<p>"She is the only woman in the world!" he exclaimed with an
oath.<br>
 "Look at her action."</p>

<p>I, for my part, leaped at this opportunity for a little
further<br>
 light.</p>

<p>"See here, Northmour," said I; "we are all in a tight place,
are we<br>
 not?"</p>

<p>"I believe you, my boy," he answered, looking me in the eyes,
and<br>
 with great emphasis. "We have all hell upon us, that's the
truth.<br>
 You may believe me or not, but I'm afraid of my life."</p>

<p>"Tell me one thing," said I. "What are they after, these
Italians?<br>
 What do they want with Mr. Huddlestone?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" he cried. "The black old scamp had
carbonari<br>
 funds on a deposit--two hundred and eighty thousand; and of
course<br>
 he gambled it away on stocks. There was to have been a
revolution<br>
 in the Tridentino, or Parma; but the revolution is off, and
the<br>
 whole wasp's nest is after Huddlestone. We shall all be lucky
if<br>
 we can save our skins."</p>

<p>"The carbonari!" I exclaimed; "God help him indeed!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" said Northmour. "And now, look here: I have said that
we<br>
 are in a fix; and, frankly, I shall be glad of your help. If
I<br>
 can't save Huddlestone, I want at least to save the girl. Come
and<br>
 stay in the pavilion; and, there's my hand on it, I shall act
as<br>
 your friend until the old man is either clear or dead. But,"
he<br>
 added, "once that is settled, you become my rival once again,
and I<br>
 warn you--mind yourself."</p>

<p>"Done!" said I; and we shook hands.</p>

<p>"And now let us go directly to the fort," said Northmour; and
he<br>
 began to lead the way through the rain.</p>

<h3><br>
 VI</h3>

<p><br>
 We were admitted to the pavilion by Clara, and I was surprised
by<br>
 the completeness and security of the defenses. A barricade
of<br>
 great strength, and yet easy to displace, supported the door<br>
 against any violence from without; and the shutters of the
dining-<br>
 room, into which I was led directly, and which was feebly<br>
 illuminated by a lamp, were even more elaborately fortified.
The<br>
 panels were strengthened by bars and crossbars; and these, in
their<br>
 turn, were kept in position by a system of braces and struts,
some<br>
 abutting on the floor, some on the roof, and others, in
fine,<br>
 against the opposite wall of the apartment. It was at once a
solid<br>
 and well-designed piece of carpentry; and I did not seek to
conceal<br>
 my admiration.</p>

<p><br>
 "I am the engineer," said Northmour. "You remember the planks
in<br>
 the garden? Behold them?"</p>

<p>"I did not know you had so many talents," said I.</p>

<p>"Are you armed?" he continued, pointing to an array of guns
and<br>
 pistols, all in admirable order, which stood in line against
the<br>
 wall or were displayed upon the sideboard.</p>

<p>"Thank you," I returned; "I have gone armed since our last<br>
 encounter. But, to tell you the truth, I have had nothing to
eat<br>
 since early yesterday evening."</p>

<p>Northmour produced some cold meat, to which I eagerly set
myself,<br>
 and a bottle of good Burgundy, by which, wet as I was, I did
not<br>
 scruple to profit. I have always been an extreme temperance man
on<br>
 principle; but it is useless to push principle to excess, and
on<br>
 this occasion I believe that I finished three quarters of
the<br>
 bottle. As I eat, I still continued to admire the preparations
for<br>
 defense.</p>

<p>"We could stand a siege," I said at length.</p>

<p>"Ye--es," drawled Northmour; "a very little one, perhaps. It
is<br>
 not so much the strength of the pavilion I misdoubt; it is
the<br>
 double danger that kills me. If we get to shooting, wild as
the<br>
 country is, some one is sure to hear it, and then--why then
it's<br>
 the same thing, only different, as they say: caged by law,
or<br>
 killed by carbonari. There's the choice. It is a devilish
bad<br>
 thing to have the law against you in this world, and so I tell
the<br>
 old gentleman upstairs. He is quite of my way of thinking."</p>

<p>"Speaking of that," said I, "what kind of person is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he!" cried the other; "he's a rancid fellow, as far as
he<br>
 goes. I should like to have his neck wrung to-morrow by all
the<br>
 devils in Italy. I am not in this affair for him. You take me?
I<br>
 made a bargain for missy's hand, and I mean to have it too."</p>

<p>"That, by the way," said I. "I understand. But how will
Mr.<br>
 Huddlestone take my intrusion?"</p>

<p>"Leave that to Clara," returned Northmour.</p>

<p>I could have struck him in the face for his coarse
familiarity; but<br>
 I respected the truce, as, I am bound to say, did Northmour, and
so<br>
 long as the danger continued not a cloud arose in our relation.
I<br>
 bear him this testimony with the most unfeigned satisfaction;
nor<br>
 am I without pride when I look back upon my own behavior.
For<br>
 surely no two men were ever left in a position so invidious
and<br>
 irritating.</p>

<p>As soon as I had done eating, we proceeded to inspect the
lower<br>
 floor. Window by window we tried the different supports, now
and<br>
 then making an inconsiderable change; and the strokes of the
hammer<br>
 sounded with startling loudness through the house. I proposed,
I<br>
 remember, to make loopholes; but he told me they were already
made<br>
 in the windows of the upper story. It was an anxious
business,<br>
 this inspection, and left me down-hearted. There were two
doors<br>
 and five windows to protect, and, counting Clara, only four of
us<br>
 to defend them against an unknown number of foes. I
communicated<br>
 my doubts to Northmour, who assured me, with unmoved
composure,<br>
 that he entirely shared them.</p>

<p>"Before morning," said he, "we shall all be butchered and
buried in<br>
 Graden Floe. For me, that is written."</p>

<p>I could not help shuddering at the mention of the quicksand,
but<br>
 reminded Northmour that our enemies had spared me in the
wood.</p>

<p>"Do not flatter yourself," said he. "Then you were not in the
same<br>
 boat with the old gentleman; now you are. It's the floe for all
of<br>
 us, mark my words."</p>

<p>I trembled for Clara; and just then her dear voice was
heard<br>
 calling us to come upstairs. Northmour showed me the way,
and,<br>
 when he had reached the landing, knocked at the door of what
used<br>
 to be called My Uncle's Bedroom, as the founder of the pavilion
had<br>
 designed it especially for himself.</p>

<p>"Come in, Northmour; come in, dear Mr. Cassilis," said a voice
from<br>
 within.</p>

<p>Pushing open the door, Northmour admitted me before him into
the<br>
 apartment. As I came in I could see the daughter slipping out
by<br>
 the side door into the study, which had been prepared as her<br>
 bedroom. In the bed, which was drawn back against the wall,<br>
 instead of standing, as I had last seen it, boldly across
the<br>
 window, sat Bernard Huddlestone, the defaulting banker. Little
as<br>
 I had seen of him by the shifting light of the lantern on
the<br>
 links, I had no difficulty in recognizing him for the same. He
had<br>
 a long and sallow countenance, surrounded by a long red beard
and<br>
 side-whiskers. His broken nose and high cheek-hones gave him<br>
 somewhat the air of a Kalmuck, and his light eyes shone with
the<br>
 excitement of a high fever. He wore a skull-cap of black silk;
a<br>
 huge Bible lay open before him on the bed, with a pair of
gold<br>
 spectacles in the place, and a pile of other books lay on the
stand<br>
 by his side. The green curtains lent a cadaverous shade to
his<br>
 cheek; and, as he sat propped on pillows, his great stature
was<br>
 painfully hunched, and his head protruded till it overhung
his<br>
 knees. I believe if he had not died otherwise, he must have
fallen<br>
 a victim to consumption in the course of but a very few
weeks.</p>

<p>He held out to me a hand, long, thin, and disagreeably
hairy.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in, Mr. Cassilis," said he. "Another
protector--<br>
 ahem!--another protector. Always welcome as a friend of my<br>
 daughter's, Mr. Cassilis. How they have rallied about me, my<br>
 daughter's friends! May God in heaven bless and reward them
for<br>
 it!"</p>

<p>I gave him my hand, of course, because I could not help it;
but the<br>
 sympathy I had been prepared to feel for Clara's father was<br>
 immediately soured by his appearance, and the wheedling,
unreal<br>
 tones in which he spoke.</p>

<p>"Cassilis is a good man," said Northmour; "worth ten."</p>

<p>"So I hear," cried Mr. Huddlestone eagerly; "so my girl tells
me.<br>
 Ah, Mr. Cassilis, my sin has found me out, you see! I am very
low,<br>
 very low; but I hope equally penitent. We must all come to
the<br>
 throne of grace at last, Mr. Cassilis. For my part, I come
late<br>
 indeed; but with unfeigned humility, I trust."</p>

<p>"Fiddle-de-dee!" said Northmour roughly.</p>

<p>"No, no, dear Northmour!" cried the banker. "You must not
say<br>
 that; you must not try to shake me. You forget, my dear, good
boy,<br>
 you forget I may be called this very night before my Maker."</p>

<p>His excitement was pitiful to behold; and I felt myself
grow<br>
 indignant with Northmour, whose infidel opinions I well knew,
and<br>
 heartily despised, as he continued to taunt the poor sinner out
of<br>
 his humor of repentance.</p>

<p>"Pooh, my dear Huddlestone!" said he. "You do yourself
injustice.<br>
 You are a man of the world inside and out, and were up to all
kinds<br>
 of mischief before I was born. Your conscience is tanned
like<br>
 South American leather--only you forgot to tan your liver,
and<br>
 that, if you will believe me, is the seat of the annoyance."</p>

<p>"Rogue, rogue! bad boy!" said Mr. Huddlestone, shaking his
finger.<br>
 "I am no precisian, if you come to that; I always hated a<br>
 precisian; but I never lost hold of something better through
it<br>
 all. I have been a bad boy, Mr. Cassilis; I do not seek to
deny<br>
 that; but it was after my wife's death, and you know, with a<br>
 widower, it's a different thing: sinful--I won't say no; but
there<br>
 is a gradation, we shall hope. And talking of that-- Hark!"
he<br>
 broke out suddenly, his hand raised, his fingers spread, his
face<br>
 racked with interest and terror. "Only the rain, bless God!"
he<br>
 added, after a pause, and with indescribable relief.</p>

<p>For some seconds he lay back among the pillows like a man near
to<br>
 fainting; then he gathered himself together, and, in
somewhat<br>
 tremulous tones, began once more to thank me for the share I
was<br>
 prepared to take in his defense.</p>

<p>"One question, sir," said I, when he had paused. "Is it true
that<br>
 you have money with you?"</p>

<p>He seemed annoyed by the question, but admitted with
reluctance<br>
 that he had a little.</p>

<p>"Well," I continued, "it is their money they are after, is it
not?<br>
 Why not give it up to them?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied he, shaking his head, "I have tried that
already, Mr.<br>
 Cassilis; and alas! that it should be so, but it is blood
they<br>
 want."</p>

<p>"Huddlestone, that's a little less than fair," said
Northmour.<br>
 "You should mention that what you offered them was upward of
two<br>
 hundred thousand short. The deficit is worth a reference; it
is<br>
 for what they call a cool sum, Frank. Then, you see, the
fellows<br>
 reason in their clear Italian way; and it seems to them, as
indeed<br>
 it seems to me, that they may just as well have both while
they're<br>
 about it--money and blood together, by George, and no more
trouble<br>
 for the extra pleasure."</p>

<p>"Is it in the pavilion?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is; and I wish it were in the bottom of the sea instead,"
said<br>
 Northmour; and then suddenly--"What are you making faces at
me<br>
 for?" he cried to Mr. Huddlestone, on whom I had
unconsciously<br>
 turned my back. "Do you think Cassilis would sell you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Huddlestone protested that nothing had been further from
his<br>
 mind.</p>

<p>"It is a good thing," retorted Northmour in his ugliest
manner.<br>
 "You might end by wearying us. What were you going to say?"
he<br>
 added, turning to me.</p>

<p>"I was going to propose an occupation for the afternoon," said
I.<br>
 "Let us carry that money out, piece by piece, and lay it
down<br>
 before the pavilion door. If the carbonari come, why, it's
theirs<br>
 at any rate."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Mr. Huddlestone; "it does not, it cannot,
belong to<br>
 them! It should be distributed pro rata among all my
creditors."</p>

<p>"Come now, Huddlestone," said Northmour, "none of that."</p>

<p>"Well, but my daughter," moaned the wretched man. "Your
daughter<br>
 will do well enough. Here are two suitors, Cassilis and I,
neither<br>
 of us beggars, between whom she has to choose. And as for<br>
 yourself, to make an end of arguments, you have no right to
a<br>
 farthing, and, unless I'm much mistaken, you are going to
die."</p>

<p>It was certainly very cruelly said; but Mr. Huddlestone was a
man<br>
 who attracted little sympathy; and, although I saw him wince
and<br>
 shudder, I mentally indorsed the rebuke; nay, I added a<br>
 contribution of my own.</p>

<p>"Northmour and I," I said, "are willing enough to help you to
save<br>
 your life, but not to escape with stolen property."</p>

<p>He struggled for awhile with himself, as though he were on
the<br>
 point of giving way to anger, but prudence had the best of
the<br>
 controversy.</p>

<p>"My dear boys," he said, "do with me or my money what you
will. I<br>
 leave all in your hands. Let me compose myself."</p>

<p>And so we left him, gladly enough I am sure.</p>

<p>The last that I saw, he had once more taken up his great
Bible, and<br>
 with tremulous hands was adjusting his spectacles to read.</p>

<h3><br>
 VII</h3>

<p><br>
 The recollection of that afternoon will always be graven on
my<br>
 mind. Northmour and I were persuaded that an attack was
imminent;<br>
 and if it had been in our power to alter in any way the order
of<br>
 events, that power would have been used to precipitate rather
than<br>
 delay the critical moment. The worst was to be anticipated; yet
we<br>
 could conceive no extremity so miserable as the suspense we
were<br>
 now suffering. I have never been an eager, though always a
great,<br>
 reader; but I never knew books so insipid as those which I took
up<br>
 and cast aside that afternoon in the pavilion. Even talk
became<br>
 impossible, as the hours went on. One or other was always<br>
 listening for some sound, or peering from an upstairs window
over<br>
 the links. And yet not a sign indicated the presence of our
foes.</p>

<p><br>
 We debated over and over again my proposal with regard to
the<br>
 money; and had we been in complete possession of our faculties,
I<br>
 am sure we should have condemned it as unwise; but we were<br>
 flustered with alarm, grasped at a straw, and determined,
although<br>
 it was as much as advertising Mr. Huddlestone's presence in
the<br>
 pavilion, to carry my proposal into effect.</p>

<p>The sum was part in specie, part in bank paper, and part
in<br>
 circular notes payable to the name of James Gregory. We took
it<br>
 out, counted it, inclosed it once more in a dispatch box
belonging<br>
 to Northmour, and prepared a letter in Italian which he tied to
the<br>
 handle. It was signed by both of us under oath, and declared
that<br>
 this was all the money which had escaped the failure of the
house<br>
 of Huddlestone. This was, perhaps, the maddest action ever<br>
 perpetrated by two persons professing to be sane. Had the
dispatch<br>
 box fallen into other hands than those for which it was
intended,<br>
 we stood criminally convicted on our own written testimony; but,
as<br>
 I have said, we were neither of us in a condition to judge
soberly,<br>
 and had a thirst for action that drove us to do something, right
or<br>
 wrong, rather than endure the agony of waiting. Moreover, as
we<br>
 were both convinced that the hollows of the links were alive
with<br>
 hidden spies upon our movements, we hoped that our appearance
with<br>
 the box might lead to a parley, and, perhaps, a compromise.</p>

<p>It was nearly three when we issued from the pavilion. The rain
had<br>
 taken off; the sun shone quite cheerfully. I had never seen
the<br>
 gulls fly so close about the house or approach so fearlessly
to<br>
 human beings. On the very doorstep one flapped heavily past
our<br>
 heads, and uttered its wild cry in my very ear.</p>

<p>"There is an omen for you," said Northmour, who like all<br>
 freethinkers was much under the influence of superstition.
"They<br>
 think we are already dead."</p>

<p>I made some light rejoinder, but it was with half my heart;
for the<br>
 circumstance had impressed me.</p>

<p>A yard or two before the gate, on a patch of smooth turf, we
set<br>
 down the dispatch box; and Northmour waved a white
handkerchief<br>
 over his head. Nothing replied. We raised our voices, and
cried<br>
 aloud in Italian that we were there as ambassadors to arrange
the<br>
 quarrel, but the stillness remained unbroken save by the
seagulls<br>
 and the surf. I had a weight at my heart when we desisted; and
I<br>
 saw that even Northmour was unusually pale. He looked over
his<br>
 shoulder nervously, as though he feared that some one had
crept<br>
 between him and the pavilion door.</p>

<p>"By God," he said in a whisper, "this is too much for me!"</p>

<p>I replied in the same key: "Suppose there should be none,
after<br>
 all!"</p>

<p>"Look there," he returned, nodding with his head, as though he
had<br>
 been afraid to point.</p>

<p>I glanced in the direction indicated; and there, from the
northern<br>
 quarter of the Sea-Wood, beheld a thin column of smoke
rising<br>
 steadily against the now cloudless sky.</p>

<p>"Northmour," I said (we still continued to talk in whispers),
"it<br>
 is not possible to endure this suspense. I prefer death
fifty<br>
 times over. Stay you here to watch the pavilion; I will go
forward<br>
 and make sure, if I have to walk right into their camp."</p>

<p>He looked once again all round him with puckered eyes, and
then<br>
 nodded assentingly to my proposal.</p>

<p>My heart heat like a sledge hammer as I set out walking
rapidly in<br>
 the direction of the smoke; and, though up to that moment I
had<br>
 felt chill and shivering, I was suddenly conscious of a glow
of<br>
 heat all over my body. The ground in this direction was very<br>
 uneven; a hundred men might have lain hidden in as many
square<br>
 yards about my path. But I who had not practiced the business
in<br>
 vain, chose such routes as cut at the very root of
concealment,<br>
 and, by keeping along the most convenient ridges, commanded
several<br>
 hollows at a time. It was not long before I was rewarded for
my<br>
 caution. Coming suddenly on to a mound somewhat more elevated
than<br>
 the surrounding hummocks, I saw, not thirty yards away, a man
bent<br>
 almost double, and running as fast as his attitude permitted,
along<br>
 the bottom of a gully. I had dislodged one of the spies from
his<br>
 ambush. As soon as I sighted him, I called loudly both in
English<br>
 and Italian; and he, seeing concealment was no longer
possible,<br>
 straightened himself out, leaped from the gully, and made off
as<br>
 straight as an arrow for the borders of the wood. It was none
of<br>
 my business to pursue; I had learned what I wanted--that we
were<br>
 beleaguered and watched in the pavilion; and I returned at
once,<br>
 and walked as nearly as possible in my old footsteps, to
where<br>
 Northmour awaited me beside the dispatch box. He was even
paler<br>
 than when I had left him, and his voice shook a little.</p>

<p>"Could you see what he was like?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He kept his back turned," I replied.</p>

<p>"Let us get into the house, Frank. I don't think I'm a coward,
but<br>
 I can stand no more of this," he whispered.</p>

<p>All was still and sunshiny about the pavilion, as we turned
to<br>
 reenter it; even the gulls had flown in a wider circuit, and
were<br>
 seen flickering along the beach and sand hills; and this
loneliness<br>
 terrified me more than a regiment under arms. It was not until
the<br>
 door was barricaded that I could draw a full inspiration and<br>
 relieve the weight that lay upon my bosom. Northmour and I<br>
 exchanged a steady glance; and I suppose each made his own<br>
 reflections on the white and startled aspect of the other.</p>

<p>"You were right," I said. "All is over. Shake hands, old man,
for<br>
 the last time."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied he, "I will shake hands; for, as sure as I am
here,<br>
 I bear no malice. But, remember, if, by some impossible
accident,<br>
 we should give the slip to these blackguards, I'll take the
upper<br>
 hand of you by fair or foul."</p>

<p>"Oh," said I, "you weary me!"</p>

<p>He seemed hurt, and walked away in silence to the foot of
the<br>
 stairs, where he paused.</p>

<p>"You do not understand," said he. "I am not a swindler, and
I<br>
 guard myself; that is all. I may weary you or not, Mr. Cassilis,
I<br>
 do not care a rush; I speak for my own satisfaction, and not
for<br>
 your amusement. You had better go upstairs and court the girl;
for<br>
 my part, I stay here."</p>

<p>"And I stay with you," I returned. "Do you think I would steal
a<br>
 march, even with your permission?"</p>

<p>"Frank," he said, smiling, "it's a pity you are an ass, for
you<br>
 have the makings of a man. I think I must be fey to-day; you<br>
 cannot irritate me even when you try. Do you know," he
continued<br>
 softly, "I think we are the two most miserable men in England,
you<br>
 and I? we have got on to thirty without wife or child, or so
much<br>
 as a shop to look after--poor, pitiful, lost devils, both! And
now<br>
 we clash about a girl! As if there were not several millions
in<br>
 the United Kingdom! Ah, Frank, Frank, the one who loses his
throw,<br>
 be it you or me, he has my pity! It were better for him--how
does<br>
 the Bible say?--that a millstone were hanged about his neck and
he<br>
 were cast into the depth of the sea. Let us take a drink,"
he<br>
 concluded suddenly, but without any levity of tone.</p>

<p>I was touched by his words, and consented. He sat down on
the<br>
 table in the dining-room, and held up the glass of sherry to
his<br>
 eye.</p>

<p>"If you beat me, Frank," he said, "I shall take to drink.
What<br>
 will you do, if it goes the other way?"</p>

<p>"God knows," I returned.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "here is a toast in the meantime: 'Italia<br>
 irredenta!'"</p>

<p>The remainder of the day was passed in the same dreadful
tedium and<br>
 suspense. I laid the table for dinner, while Northmour and
Clara<br>
 prepared the meal together in the kitchen. I could hear their
talk<br>
 as I went to and fro, and was surprised to find it ran all the
time<br>
 upon myself. Northmour again bracketed us together, and
rallied<br>
 Clara on a choice of husbands; but he continued to speak of me
with<br>
 some feeling, and uttered nothing to my prejudice unless he<br>
 included himself in the condemnation. This awakened a sense
of<br>
 gratitude in my heart, which combined with the immediateness of
our<br>
 peril to fill my eyes with tears. After all, I thought--and<br>
 perhaps the thought was laughably vain--we were here three
very<br>
 noble human beings to perish in defense of a thieving
banker.</p>

<p>Before we sat down to table, I looked forth from an
upstairs<br>
 window. The day was beginning to decline; the links were
utterly<br>
 deserted; the dispatch box still lay untouched where we had left
it<br>
 hours before.</p>

<p>Mr. Huddlestone, in a long yellow dressing gown, took one end
of<br>
 the table, Clara the other; while Northmour and I faced each
other<br>
 from the sides. The lamp was brightly trimmed; the wine was
good;<br>
 the viands, although mostly cold, excellent of their sort.
We<br>
 seemed to have agreed tacitly; all reference to the
impending<br>
 catastrophe was carefully avoided; and, considering our
tragic<br>
 circumstances, we made a merrier party than could have been<br>
 expected. From time to time, it is true, Northmour or I would
rise<br>
 from table and make a round of the defenses; and, on each of
these<br>
 occasions, Mr. Huddlestone was recalled to a sense of his
tragic<br>
 predicament, glanced up with ghastly eyes, and bore for an
instant<br>
 on his countenance the stamp of terror. But he hastened to
empty<br>
 his glass, wiped his forehead with his handkerchief, and
joined<br>
 again in the conversation.</p>

<p>I was astonished at the wit and information he displayed.
Mr.<br>
 Huddlestone's was certainly no ordinary character; he had read
and<br>
 observed for himself; his gifts were sound; and, though I
could<br>
 never have learned to love the man, I began to understand
his<br>
 success in business, and the great respect in which he had
been<br>
 held before his failure. He had, above all, the talent of
society;<br>
 and though I never heard him speak but on this one and most<br>
 unfavorable occasion, I set him down among the most
brilliant<br>
 conversationalists I ever met.</p>

<p>He was relating with great gusto, and seemingly no feeling
of<br>
 shame, the maneuvers of a scoundrelly commission merchant whom
he<br>
 had known and studied in his youth, and we were all listening
with<br>
 an odd mixture of mirth and embarrassment, when our little
party<br>
 was brought abruptly to an end in the most startling manner.</p>

<p>A noise like that of a wet finger on the window pane
interrupted<br>
 Mr. Huddlestone's tale; and in an instant we were all four as
white<br>
 as paper, and sat tongue-tied and motionless round the
table.</p>

<p>"A snail," I said at last; for I had heard that these animals
make<br>
 a noise somewhat similar in character.</p>

<p>"Snail be d--d!" said Northmour. "Hush!"</p>

<p>The same sound was repeated twice at regular intervals; and
then a<br>
 formidable voice shouted through the shutters the Italian
word,<br>
 "Traditore!"</p>

<p>Mr. Huddlestone threw his head in the air; his eyelids
quivered;<br>
 next moment he fell insensible below the table. Northmour and
I<br>
 had each run to the armory and seized a gun. Clara was on her
feet<br>
 with her hand at her throat.</p>

<p>So we stood waiting, for we thought the hour of attack was<br>
 certainly come; but second passed after second, and all but
the<br>
 surf remained silent in the neighborhood of the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Quick," said Northmour; "upstairs with him before they
come."</p>

<h3><br>
 VIII</h3>

<p><br>
 Somehow or other, by hook and crook, and between the three of
us,<br>
 we got Bernard Huddlestone bundled upstairs and laid upon the
bed<br>
 in My Uncle's Room. During the whole process, which was
rough<br>
 enough, he gave no sign of consciousness, and he remained, as
we<br>
 had thrown him, without changing the position of a finger.
His<br>
 daughter opened his shirt and began to wet his head and
bosom;<br>
 while Northmour and I ran to the window. The weather
continued<br>
 clear; the moon, which was now about full, had risen and shed
a<br>
 very clear light upon the links; yet, strain our eyes as we
might,<br>
 we could distinguish nothing moving. A few dark spots, more
or<br>
 less, on the uneven expanse were not to be identified; they
might<br>
 be crouching men, they might be shadows; it was impossible to
be<br>
 sure.</p>

<p><br>
 "Thank God," said Northmour, "Aggie is not coming to-night."</p>

<p>Aggie was the name of the old nurse; he had not thought of
her<br>
 until now; but that he should think of her at all was a trait
that<br>
 surprised me in the man.</p>

<p>We were again reduced to waiting. Northmour went to the
fireplace<br>
 and spread his hands before the red embers, as if he were cold.
I<br>
 followed him mechanically with my eyes, and in so doing turned
my<br>
 back upon the window. At that moment a very faint report was<br>
 audible from without, and a ball shivered a pane of glass,
and<br>
 buried itself in the shutter two inches from my head. I
heard<br>
 Clara scream; and though I whipped instantly out of range and
into<br>
 a corner, she was there, so to speak, before me, beseeching to
know<br>
 if I were hurt. I felt that I could stand to be shot at every
day<br>
 and all day long, with such remarks of solicitude for a reward;
and<br>
 I continued to reassure her, with the tenderest caresses and
in<br>
 complete forgetfulness of our situation, till the voice of<br>
 Northmour recalled me to myself.</p>

<p>"An air gun," he said. "They wish to make no noise."</p>

<p>I put Clara aside, and looked at him. He was standing with
his<br>
 back to the fire and his hands clasped behind him; and I knew
by<br>
 the black look on his face, that passion was boiling within. I
had<br>
 seen just such a look before he attacked me, that March night,
in<br>
 the adjoining chamber; and, though I could make every allowance
for<br>
 his anger, I confess I trembled for the consequences. He
gazed<br>
 straight before him; but he could see us with the tail of his
eye,<br>
 and his temper kept rising like a gale of wind. With regular<br>
 battle awaiting us outside, this prospect of an internecine
strife<br>
 within the walls began to daunt me.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I was thus closely watching his expression
and<br>
 prepared against the worst, I saw a change, a flash, a look
of<br>
 relief, upon his face. He took up the lamp which stood beside
him<br>
 on the table, and turned to us with an air of some
excitement.</p>

<p>"There is one point that we must know," said he. "Are they
going<br>
 to butcher the lot of us, or only Huddlestone? Did they take
you<br>
 for him, or fire at you for your own beaux yeux?"</p>

<p>"They took me for him, for certain," I replied. "I am near
as<br>
 tall, and my head is fair."</p>

<p>"I am going to make sure," returned Northmour; and he stepped
up to<br>
 the window, holding the lamp above his head, and stood
there,<br>
 quietly affronting death, for half a minute.</p>

<p>Clara sought to rush forward and pull him from the place of
danger;<br>
 but I had the pardonable selfishness to hold her back by
force.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Northmour, turning coolly from the window, "it's
only<br>
 Huddlestone they want."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Northmour!" cried Clara; but found no more to add;
the<br>
 temerity she had just witnessed seeming beyond the reach of
words.</p>

<p>He, on his part, looked at me, cocking his head, with a fire
of<br>
 triumph in his eyes; and I understood at once that he had
thus<br>
 hazarded his life, merely to attract Clara's notice, and depose
me<br>
 from my position as the hero of the hour. He snapped his
fingers.</p>

<p>"The fire is only beginning," said he. "When they warm up to
their<br>
 work, they won't be so particular."</p>

<p>A voice was now heard hailing us from the entrance. From
the<br>
 window we could see the figure of a man in the moonlight; he
stood<br>
 motionless, his face uplifted to ours, and a rag of something
white<br>
 on his extended arm; and as we looked right down upon him,
though<br>
 he was a good many yards distant on the links, we could see
the<br>
 moonlight glitter on his eyes.</p>

<p>He opened his lips again, and spoke for some minutes on end,
in a<br>
 key so loud that he might have been heard in every corner of
the<br>
 pavilion, and as far away as the borders of the wood. It was
the<br>
 same voice that had already shouted, "Traditore!" through
the<br>
 shutters of the dining-room; this time it made a complete and
clear<br>
 statement. If the traitor "Oddlestone" were given up, all
others<br>
 should be spared; if not, no one should escape to tell the
tale.</p>

<p>"Well, Huddlestone, what do you say to that?" asked
Northmour,<br>
 turning to the bed.</p>

<p>Up to that moment the banker had given no sign of life, and I,
at<br>
 least, had supposed him to be still lying in a faint; but he<br>
 replied at once, and in such tones as I have never heard
elsewhere,<br>
 save from a delirious patient, adjured and besought us not
to<br>
 desert him. It was the most hideous and abject performance that
my<br>
 imagination can conceive.</p>

<p>"Enough," cried Northmour; and then he threw open the
window,<br>
 leaned out into the night, and in a tone of exultation, and with
a<br>
 total forgetfulness of what was due to the presence of a
lady,<br>
 poured out upon the ambassador a string of the most
abominable<br>
 raillery both in English and Italian, and bade him be gone where
he<br>
 had come from. I believe that nothing so delighted Northmour
at<br>
 that moment as the thought that we must all infallibly
perish<br>
 before the night was out.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Italian put his flag of truce into his pocket,
and<br>
 disappeared, at a leisurely pace, among the sand hills.</p>

<p>"They make honorable war," said Northmour. "They are all
gentlemen<br>
 and soldiers. For the credit of the thing, I wish we could
change<br>
 sides--you and I, Frank, and you, too, missy, my darling--and
leave<br>
 that being on the bed to some one else. Tut! Don't look
shocked!<br>
 We are all going post to what they call eternity, and may as
well<br>
 be above board while there's time. As far as I am concerned, if
I<br>
 could first strangle Huddlestone and then get Clara in my arms,
I<br>
 could die with some pride and satisfaction. And as it is, by
God,<br>
 I'll have a kiss!"</p>

<p>Before I could do anything to interfere, he had rudely
embraced and<br>
 repeatedly kissed the resisting girl. Next moment I had pulled
him<br>
 away with fury, and flung him heavily against the wall. He
laughed<br>
 loud and long, and I feared his wits had given way under the<br>
 strain; for even in the best of days he had been a sparing and
a<br>
 quiet laugher.</p>

<p>"Now, Frank," said he, when his mirth was somewhat appeased,
"it's<br>
 your turn. Here's my hand. Good-bye, farewell!" Then, seeing
me<br>
 stand rigid and indignant, and holding Clara to my side--"Man!"
he<br>
 broke out, "are you angry? Did you think we were going to die
with<br>
 all the airs and graces of society? I took a kiss; I'm glad I
did<br>
 it; and now you can take another if you like, and square
accounts."</p>

<p>I turned from him with a feeling of contempt which I did not
seek<br>
 to dissemble.</p>

<p>"As you please," said he. "You've been a prig in life; a
prig<br>
 you'll die."</p>

<p>And with that he sat down in a chair, a rifle over his knee,
and<br>
 amused himself with snapping the lock; but I could see that
his<br>
 ebullition of light spirits (the only one I ever knew him to<br>
 display) had already come to an end, and was succeeded by a
sullen,<br>
 scowling humor.</p>

<p>All this time our assailants might have been entering the
house,<br>
 and we been none the wiser; we had in truth almost forgotten
the<br>
 danger that so imminently overhung our days. But just then
Mr.<br>
 Huddlestone uttered a cry, and leaped from the bed.</p>

<p>I asked him what was wrong.</p>

<p>"Fire!" he cried. "They have set the house on fire!"</p>

<p>Northmour was on his feet in an instant, and he and I ran
through<br>
 the door of communication with the study. The room was
illuminated<br>
 by a red and angry light. Almost at the moment of our entrance,
a<br>
 tower of flame arose in front of the window, and, with a
tingling<br>
 report, a pane fell inward on the carpet. They had set fire to
the<br>
 lean-to outhouse, where Northmour used to nurse his
negatives.</p>

<p>"Hot work," said Northmour. "Let us try in your old room."</p>

<p>We ran thither in a breath, threw up the casement, and
looked<br>
 forth. Along the whole back wall of the pavilion piles of fuel
had<br>
 been arranged and kindled; and it is probable they had been<br>
 drenched with mineral oil, for, in spite of the morning's
rain,<br>
 they all burned bravely. The fire had taken a firm hold already
on<br>
 the outhouse, which blazed higher and higher every moment; the
back<br>
 door was in the center of a red-hot bonfire; the eaves we
could<br>
 see, as we looked upward, were already smoldering, for the
roof<br>
 overhung, and was supported by considerable beams of wood. At
the<br>
 same time, hot, pungent, and choking volumes of smoke began to
fill<br>
 the house. There was not a human being to be seen to right
or<br>
 left.</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" said Northmour, "here's the end, thank God!"</p>

<p>And we returned to My Uncle's Room. Mr. Huddlestone was
putting on<br>
 his boots, still violently trembling, but with an air of<br>
 determination such as I had not hitherto observed. Clara
stood<br>
 close by him, with her cloak in both hands ready to throw about
her<br>
 shoulders, and a strange look in her eyes, as if she were
half<br>
 hopeful, half doubtful of her father.</p>

<p>"Well, boys and girls," said Northmour, "how about a sally?
The<br>
 oven is heating; it is not good to stay here and be baked; and,
for<br>
 my part, I want to come to my hands with them, and be done."</p>

<p>"There's nothing else left," I replied.</p>

<p>And both Clara and Mr. Huddlestone, though with a very
different<br>
 intonation, added, "Nothing."</p>

<p>As we went downstairs the heat was excessive, and the roaring
of<br>
 the fire filled our ears; and we had scarce reached the
passage<br>
 before the stairs window fell in, a branch of flame shot<br>
 brandishing through the aperture, and the interior of the
pavilion<br>
 became lighted up with that dreadful and fluctuating glare. At
the<br>
 same moment we heard the fall of something heavy and inelastic
in<br>
 the upper story. The whole pavilion, it was plain, had gone
alight<br>
 like a box of matches, and now not only flamed sky high to land
and<br>
 sea, but threatened with every moment to crumble and fall in
about<br>
 our ears.</p>

<p>Northmour and I cocked our revolvers. Mr. Huddlestone, who
had<br>
 already refused a firearm, put us behind him with a manner
of<br>
 command.</p>

<p>"Let Clara open the door," said he. "So, if they fire a
volley,<br>
 she will be protected. And in the meantime stand behind me. I
am<br>
 the scapegoat; my sins have found me out."</p>

<p>I heard him, as I stood breathless by his shoulder, with my
pistol<br>
 ready, pattering off prayers in a tremulous, rapid whisper; and,
I<br>
 confess, horrid as the thought may seem, I despised him for<br>
 thinking of supplications in a moment so critical and
thrilling.<br>
 In the meantime, Clara, who was dead white but still possessed
her<br>
 faculties, had displaced the barricade from the front door.<br>
 Another moment, and she had pulled it open. Firelight and<br>
 moonlight illuminated the links with confused and changeful
luster,<br>
 and far away against the sky we could see a long trail of
glowing<br>
 smoke.</p>

<p>Mr. Huddlestone, filled for the moment with a strength greater
than<br>
 his own, struck Northmour and myself a back-hander in the
chest;<br>
 and while we were thus for the moment incapacitated from
action,<br>
 lifting his arms above his head like one about to dive, he
ran<br>
 straight forward out of the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Here am I!" he cried--"Huddlestone! Kill me, and spare
the<br>
 others!"</p>

<p>His sudden appearance daunted, I suppose, our hidden enemies;
for<br>
 Northmour and I had time to recover, to seize Clara between us,
one<br>
 by each arm, and to rush forth to his assistance, ere
anything<br>
 further had taken place. But scarce had we passed the
threshold<br>
 when there came near a dozen reports and flashes from every<br>
 direction among the hollows of the links. Mr. Huddlestone<br>
 staggered, uttered a weird and freezing cry, threw up his arms
over<br>
 his head, and fell backward on the turf.</p>

<p>"Traditore! Traditore!" cried the invisible avengers.</p>

<p>And just then a part of the roof of the pavilion fell in, so
rapid<br>
 was the progress of the fire. A loud, vague, and horrible
noise<br>
 accompanied the collapse, and a vast volume of flame went
soaring<br>
 up to heaven. It must have been visible at that moment from
twenty<br>
 miles out at sea, from the shore at Graden Wester, and far
inland<br>
 from the peak of Graystiel, the most eastern summit of the
Caulder<br>
 Hills. Bernard Huddlestone, although God knows what were his<br>
 obsequies, had a fine pyre at the moment of his death.</p>

<h3><br>
 IX</h3>

<p><br>
 I should have the greatest difficulty to tell you what
followed<br>
 next after this tragic circumstance. It is all to me, as I
look<br>
 back upon it, mixed, strenuous, and ineffectual, like the
struggles<br>
 of a sleeper in a nightmare. Clara, I remember, uttered a
broken<br>
 sigh and would have fallen forward to earth, had not Northmour
and<br>
 I supported her insensible body. I do not think we were
attacked:<br>
 I do not remember even to have seen an assailant; and I believe
we<br>
 deserted Mr. Huddlestone without a glance. I only remember
running<br>
 like a man in a panic, now carrying Clara altogether in my
own<br>
 arms, now sharing her weight with Northmour, now scuffling<br>
 confusedly for the possession of that dear burden. Why we
should<br>
 have made for my camp in the Hemlock Den, or how we reached it,
are<br>
 points lost forever to my recollection. The first moment at
which<br>
 I became definitely sure, Clara had been suffered to fall
against<br>
 the outside of my little tent, Northmour and I were tumbling<br>
 together on the ground, and he, with contained ferocity, was<br>
 striking for my head with the butt of his revolver. He had
already<br>
 twice wounded me on the scalp; and it is to the consequent loss
of<br>
 blood that I am tempted to attribute the sudden clearness of
my<br>
 mind.</p>

<p><br>
 I caught him by the wrist.</p>

<p>"Northmour," I remember saying, "you can kill me afterwards.
Let<br>
 us first attend to Clara."</p>

<p>He was at that moment uppermost. Scarcely had the words passed
my<br>
 lips, when he had leaped to his feet and ran toward the tent;
and<br>
 the next moment, he was straining Clara to his heart and
covering<br>
 her unconscious hands and face with his caresses.</p>

<p>"Shame!" I cried. "Shame to you, Northmour!"</p>

<p>And, giddy though I still was, I struck him repeatedly upon
the<br>
 head and shoulders.</p>

<p>He relinquished his grasp, and faced me in the broken
moonlight.</p>

<p>"I had you under, and I let you go," said he; "and now you
strike<br>
 me! Coward!"</p>

<p>"You are the coward," I retorted. "Did she wish your kisses
while<br>
 she was still sensible of what you wanted? Not she! And now
she<br>
 may be dying; and you waste this precious time, and abuse
her<br>
 helplessness. Stand aside, and let me help her."</p>

<p>He confronted me for a moment, white and menacing; then
suddenly he<br>
 stepped aside.</p>

<p>"Help her then," said he.</p>

<p>I threw myself on my knees beside her, and loosened, as well
as I<br>
 was able, her dress and corset; but while I was thus engaged,
a<br>
 grasp descended on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Keep your hands off her," said Northmour, fiercely. "Do you
think<br>
 I have no blood in my veins?"</p>

<p>"Northmour," I cried, "if you will neither help her yourself,
nor<br>
 let me do so, do you know that I shall have to kill you?"</p>

<p>"That is better!" he cried. "Let her die also, where's the
harm?<br>
 Step aside from that girl! and stand up to fight."</p>

<p>"You will observe," said I, half rising, "that I have not
kissed<br>
 her yet."</p>

<p>"I dare you to," he cried.</p>

<p>I do not know what possessed me; it was one of the things I am
most<br>
 ashamed of in my life, though, as my wife used to say, I knew
that<br>
 my kisses would be always welcome were she dead or living; down
I<br>
 fell again upon my knees, parted the hair from her forehead,
and,<br>
 with the dearest respect, laid my lips for a moment on that
cold<br>
 brow. It was such a caress as a father might have given; it
was<br>
 such a one as was not unbecoming from a man soon to die to a
woman<br>
 already dead.</p>

<p>"And now," said I, "I am at your service, Mr. Northmour."</p>

<p>But I saw, to my surprise, that he had turned his back upon
me.</p>

<p>"Do you hear?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "I do. If you wish to fight, I am ready. If
not,<br>
 go on and save Clara. All is one to me."</p>

<p>I did not wait to be twice bidden; but, stooping again over
Clara,<br>
 continued my efforts to revive her. She still lay white and<br>
 lifeless; I began to fear that her sweet spirit had indeed
fled<br>
 beyond recall, and horror and a sense of utter desolation
seized<br>
 upon my heart. I called her by name with the most endearing<br>
 inflections; I chafed and beat her hands; now I laid her head
low,<br>
 now supported it against my knee; but all seemed to be in vain,
and<br>
 the lids still lay heavy on her eyes.</p>

<p>"Northmour," I said, "there is my hat. For God's sake bring
some<br>
 water from the spring."</p>

<p>Almost in a moment he was by my side with the water.</p>

<p>"I have brought it in my own," he said. "You do not grudge me
the<br>
 privilege?"</p>

<p>"Northmour," I was beginning to say, as I laved her head
and<br>
 breast; but he interrupted me savagely.</p>

<p>"Oh, you hush up!" he said. "The best thing you can do is to
say<br>
 nothing."</p>

<p>I had certainly no desire to talk, my mind being swallowed up
in<br>
 concern for my dear love and her condition; so I continued
in<br>
 silence to do my best toward her recovery, and, when the hat
was<br>
 empty, returned it to him, with one word--"More." He had,
perhaps,<br>
 gone several times upon this errand, when Clara reopened her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "since she is better, you can spare me, can
you<br>
 not? I wish you a good night, Mr. Cassilis."</p>

<p>And with that he was gone among the thicket. I made a fire,
for I<br>
 had now no fear of the Italians, who had even spared all the
little<br>
 possessions left in my encampment; and, broken as she was by
the<br>
 excitement and the hideous catastrophe of the evening, I
managed,<br>
 in one way or another--by persuasion, encouragement, warmth,
and<br>
 such simple remedies as I could lay my hand on--to bring her
back<br>
 to some composure of mind and strength of body.</p>

<p>Day had already come, when a sharp "Hist!" sounded from
the<br>
 thicket. I started from the ground; but the voice of Northmour
was<br>
 heard adding, in the most tranquil tones: "Come here, Cassilis,
and<br>
 alone; I want to show you something."</p>

<p>I consulted Clara with my eyes, and, receiving her tacit<br>
 permission, left her alone, and clambered out of the den. At
some<br>
 distance off I saw Northmour leaning against an elder; and, as
soon<br>
 as he perceived me, he began walking seaward. I had almost<br>
 overtaken him as he reached the outskirts of the wood.</p>

<p>"Look," said he, pausing.</p>

<p>A couple of steps more brought me out of the foliage. The
light of<br>
 the morning lay cold and clear over that well-known scene.
The<br>
 pavilion was but a blackened wreck; the roof had fallen in, one
of<br>
 the gables had fallen out; and, far and near, the face of the
links<br>
 was cicatrized with little patches of burned furze. Thick
smoke<br>
 still went straight upward in the windless air of the morning,
and<br>
 a great pile of ardent cinders filled the bare walls of the
house,<br>
 like coals in an open grate. Close by the islet a schooner
yacht<br>
 lay to, and a well-manned boat was pulling vigorously for
the<br>
 shore.</p>

<p>"The 'Red Earl'!" I cried. "The 'Red Earl' twelve hours too
late!"</p>

<p>"Feel in your pocket, Frank. Are you armed?" asked
Northmour.</p>

<p>I obeyed him, and I think I must have become deadly pale.
My<br>
 revolver had been taken from me.</p>

<p>"You see, I have you in my power," he continued. "I disarmed
you<br>
 last night while you were nursing Clara; but this
morning--here--<br>
 take your pistol. No thanks!" he cried, holding up his hand.
"I<br>
 do not like them; that is the only way you can annoy me
now."</p>

<p>He began to walk forward across the links to meet the boat,
and I<br>
 followed a step or two behind. In front of the pavilion I
paused<br>
 to see where Mr. Huddlestone had fallen; but there was no sign
of<br>
 him, nor so much as a trace of blood.</p>

<p>"Graden Floe," said Northmour.</p>

<p>He continued to advance till we had come to the head of the
beach.</p>

<p>"No farther, please," said he. "Would you like to take her
to<br>
 Graden House?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied I; "I shall try to get her to the
minister at<br>
 Graden Wester."</p>

<p>The prow of the boat here grated on the beach, and a sailor
jumped<br>
 ashore with a line in his hand.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, lads!" cried Northmour; and then lower and to
my<br>
 private ear, "You had better say nothing of all this to her,"
he<br>
 added.</p>

<p>"On the contrary!" I broke out, "she shall know everything
that I<br>
 can tell."</p>

<p>"You do not understand," he returned, with an air of great
dignity.<br>
 "It will be nothing to her; she expects it of me. Good-by!"
he<br>
 added, with a nod.</p>

<p>I offered him my hand.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said he. "It's small, I know; but I can't push
things<br>
 quite so far as that. I don't wish any sentimental business,
to<br>
 sit by your hearth a white-haired wanderer, and all that.
Quite<br>
 the contrary: I hope to God I shall never again clap eyes on
either<br>
 one of you."</p>

<p>"Well, God bless you, Northmour!" I said heartily.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he returned.</p>

<p>He walked down the beach; and the man who was ashore gave him
an<br>
 arm on board, and then shoved off and leaped into the bows
himself.<br>
 Northmour took the tiller; the boat rose to the waves, and the
oars<br>
 between the tholepins sounded crisp and measured in the
morning<br>
 air.</p>

<p>They were not yet half way to the "Red Earl," and I was
still<br>
 watching their progress, when the sun rose out of the sea.</p>

<p>One word more, and my story is done. Years after, Northmour
was<br>
 killed fighting under the colors of Garibaldi for the liberation
of<br>
 the Tyrol.</p>

 "Hullo, there! Hostler! Hullo-o-o!"</p>

<p>"My dear! why don't you look for the bell?"</p>

<p>"I HAVE looked--there is no bell."</p>

<p>"And nobody in the yard. How very extraordinary! Call
again,<br>
 dear."</p>

<p>"Hostler! Hullo, there! Hostler-r-r!"</p>

<p><br>
 My second call echoes through empty space, and rouses
nobody--<br>
 produces, in short, no visible result. I am at the end of my<br>
 resources--I don't know what to say or what to do next. Here
I<br>
 stand in the solitary inn yard of a strange town, with two
horses<br>
 to hold, and a lady to take care of. By way of adding to my<br>
 responsibilities, it so happens that one of the horses is
dead<br>
 lame, and that the lady is my wife.</p>

<p>Who am I?--you will ask.</p>

<p>There is plenty of time to answer the question. Nothing
happens;<br>
 and nobody appears to receive us. Let me introduce myself and
my<br>
 wife.</p>

<p>I am Percy Fairbank--English gentleman--age (let us say)
forty--no<br>
 profession--moderate politics--middle height--fair
complexion--easy<br>
 character--plenty of money.</p>

<p>My wife is a French lady. She was Mademoiselle Clotilde
Delorge--<br>
 when I was first presented to her at her father's house in
France.<br>
 I fell in love with her--I really don't know why. It might
have<br>
 been because I was perfectly idle, and had nothing else to do
at<br>
 the time. Or it might have been because all my friends said
she<br>
 was the very last woman whom I ought to think of marrying. On
the<br>
 surface, I must own, there is nothing in common between Mrs.<br>
 Fairbank and me. She is tall; she is dark; she is nervous,<br>
 excitable, romantic; in all her opinions she proceeds to
extremes.<br>
 What could such a woman see in me? what could I see in her? I
know<br>
 no more than you do. In some mysterious manner we exactly
suit<br>
 each other. We have been man and wife for ten years, and our
only<br>
 regret is, that we have no children. I don't know what YOU
may<br>
 think; I call that--upon the whole--a happy marriage.</p>

<p>So much for ourselves. The next question is--what has brought
us<br>
 into the inn yard? and why am I obliged to turn groom, and hold
the<br>
 horses?</p>

<p>We live for the most part in France--at the country house in
which<br>
 my wife and I first met. Occasionally, by way of variety, we
pay<br>
 visits to my friends in England. We are paying one of those
visits<br>
 now. Our host is an old college friend of mine, possessed of
a<br>
 fine estate in Somersetshire; and we have arrived at his
house--<br>
 called Farleigh Hall--toward the close of the hunting
season.</p>

<p>On the day of which I am now writing--destined to be a
memorable<br>
 day in our calendar--the hounds meet at Farleigh Hall. Mrs.<br>
 Fairbank and I are mounted on two of the best horses in my
friend's<br>
 stables. We are quite unworthy of that distinction; for we
know<br>
 nothing and care nothing about hunting. On the other hand,
we<br>
 delight in riding, and we enjoy the breezy Spring morning and
the<br>
 fair and fertile English landscape surrounding us on every
side.<br>
 While the hunt prospers, we follow the hunt. But when a
check<br>
 occurs--when time passes and patience is sorely tried; when
the<br>
 bewildered dogs run hither and thither, and strong language
falls<br>
 from the lips of exasperated sportsmen--we fail to take any
further<br>
 interest in the proceedings. We turn our horses' heads in
the<br>
 direction of a grassy lane, delightfully shaded by trees. We
trot<br>
 merrily along the lane, and find ourselves on an open common.
We<br>
 gallop across the common, and follow the windings of a second
lane.<br>
 We cross a brook, we pass through a village, we emerge into<br>
 pastoral solitude among the hills. The horses toss their
heads,<br>
 and neigh to each other, and enjoy it as much as we do. The
hunt<br>
 is forgotten. We are as happy as a couple of children; we
are<br>
 actually singing a French song--when in one moment our
merriment<br>
 comes to an end. My wife's horse sets one of his forefeet on
a<br>
 loose stone, and stumbles. His rider's ready hand saves him
from<br>
 falling. But, at the first attempt he makes to go on, the
sad<br>
 truth shows itself--a tendon is strained; the horse is lame.</p>

<p>What is to be done? We are strangers in a lonely part of
the<br>
 country. Look where we may, we see no signs of a human
habitation.<br>
 There is nothing for it but to take the bridle road up the
hill,<br>
 and try what we can discover on the other side. I transfer
the<br>
 saddles, and mount my wife on my own horse. He is not used
to<br>
 carry a lady; he misses the familiar pressure of a man's legs
on<br>
 either side of him; he fidgets, and starts, and kicks up the
dust.<br>
 I follow on foot, at a respectful distance from his heels,
leading<br>
 the lame horse. Is there a more miserable object on the face
of<br>
 creation than a lame horse? I have seen lame men and lame dogs
who<br>
 were cheerful creatures; but I never yet saw a lame horse
who<br>
 didn't look heartbroken over his own misfortune.</p>

<p>For half an hour my wife capers and curvets sideways along
the<br>
 bridle road. I trudge on behind her; and the heartbroken
horse<br>
 halts behind me. Hard by the top of the hill, our melancholy<br>
 procession passes a Somersetshire peasant at work in a field.
I<br>
 summon the man to approach us; and the man looks at me
stolidly,<br>
 from the middle of the field, without stirring a step. I ask
at<br>
 the top of my voice how far it is to Farleigh Hall. The<br>
 Somersetshire peasant answers at the top of HIS voice:</p>

<p>"Vourteen mile. Gi' oi a drap o' zyder."</p>

<p>I translate (for my wife's benefit) from the Somersetshire
language<br>
 into the English language. We are fourteen miles from
Farleigh<br>
 Hall; and our friend in the field desires to be rewarded,
for<br>
 giving us that information, with a drop of cider. There is
the<br>
 peasant, painted by himself! Quite a bit of character, my
dear!<br>
 Quite a bit of character!</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairbank doesn't view the study of agricultural human
nature<br>
 with my relish. Her fidgety horse will not allow her a
moment's<br>
 repose; she is beginning to lose her temper.</p>

<p>"We can't go fourteen miles in this way," she says. "Where is
the<br>
 nearest inn? Ask that brute in the field!"</p>

<p>I take a shilling from my pocket and hold it up in the sun.
The<br>
 shilling exercises magnetic virtues. The shilling draws the<br>
 peasant slowly toward me from the middle of the field. I
inform<br>
 him that we want to put up the horses and to hire a carriage
to<br>
 take us back to Farleigh Hall. Where can we do that? The
peasant<br>
 answers (with his eye on the shilling):</p>

<p>"At Oonderbridge, to be zure." (At Underbridge, to be
sure.)</p>

<p>"Is it far to Underbridge?"</p>

<p>The peasant repeats, "Var to Oonderbridge?"--and laughs at
the<br>
 question. "Hoo-hoo-hoo!" (Underbridge is evidently close
by--if<br>
 we could only find it.) "Will you show us the way, my man?"
"Will<br>
 you gi' oi a drap of zyder?" I courteously bend my head, and
point<br>
 to the shilling. The agricultural intelligence exerts itself.
The<br>
 peasant joins our melancholy procession. My wife is a fine
woman,<br>
 but he never once looks at my wife--and, more extraordinary
still,<br>
 he never even looks at the horses. His eyes are with his
mind--and<br>
 his mind is on the shilling.</p>

<p>We reach the top of the hill--and, behold on the other
side,<br>
 nestling in a valley, the shrine of our pilgrimage, the town
of<br>
 Underbridge! Here our guide claims his shilling, and leaves us
to<br>
 find out the inn for ourselves. I am constitutionally a
polite<br>
 man. I say "Good morning" at parting. The guide looks at me
with<br>
 the shilling between his teeth to make sure that it is a good
one.<br>
 "Marnin!" he says savagely--and turns his back on us, as if we
had<br>
 offended him. A curious product, this, of the growth of<br>
 civilization. If I didn't see a church spire at Underbridge,
I<br>
 might suppose that we had lost ourselves on a savage island.</p>

<h3><br>
 II</h3>

<p><br>
 Arriving at the town, we had no difficulty in finding the inn.
The<br>
 town is composed of one desolate street; and midway in that
street<br>
 stands the inn--an ancient stone building sadly out of repair.
The<br>
 painting on the sign-board is obliterated. The shutters over
the<br>
 long range of front windows are all closed. A cock and his
hens<br>
 are the only living creatures at the door. Plainly, this is one
of<br>
 the old inns of the stage-coach period, ruined by the railway.
We<br>
 pass through the open arched doorway, and find no one to
welcome<br>
 us. We advance into the stable yard behind; I assist my wife
to<br>
 dismount--and there we are in the position already disclosed
to<br>
 view at the opening of this narrative. No bell to ring. No
human<br>
 creature to answer when I call. I stand helpless, with the
bridles<br>
 of the horses in my hand. Mrs. Fairbank saunters gracefully
down<br>
 the length of the yard and does--what all women do, when they
find<br>
 themselves in a strange place. She opens every door as she
passes<br>
 it, and peeps in. On my side, I have just recovered my breath,
I<br>
 am on the point of shouting for the hostler for the third and
last<br>
 time, when I hear Mrs. Fairbank suddenly call to me:</p>

<p><br>
 "Percy! come here!"</p>

<p>Her voice is eager and agitated. She has opened a last door at
the<br>
 end of the yard, and has started back from some sight which
has<br>
 suddenly met her view. I hitch the horses' bridles on a rusty
nail<br>
 in the wall near me, and join my wife. She has turned pale,
and<br>
 catches me nervously by the arm.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" she cries; "look at that!"</p>

<p>I look--and what do I see? I see a dingy little stable,
containing<br>
 two stalls. In one stall a horse is munching his corn. In
the<br>
 other a man is lying asleep on the litter.</p>

<p>A worn, withered, woebegone man in a hostler's dress. His
hollow<br>
 wrinkled cheeks, his scanty grizzled hair, his dry yellow
skin,<br>
 tell their own tale of past sorrow or suffering. There is an<br>
 ominous frown on his eyebrows--there is a painful nervous<br>
 contraction on the side of his mouth. I hear him breathing<br>
 convulsively when I first look in; he shudders and sighs in
his<br>
 sleep. It is not a pleasant sight to see, and I turn round<br>
 instinctively to the bright sunlight in the yard. My wife turns
me<br>
 back again in the direction of the stable door.</p>

<p>"Wait!" she says. "Wait! he may do it again."</p>

<p>"Do what again?"</p>

<p>"He was talking in his sleep, Percy, when I first looked in.
He<br>
 was dreaming some dreadful dream. Hush! he's beginning
again."</p>

<p>I look and listen. The man stirs on his miserable bed. The
man<br>
 speaks in a quick, fierce whisper through his clinched
teeth.<br>
 "Wake up! Wake up, there! Murder!"</p>

<p>There is an interval of silence. He moves one lean arm
slowly<br>
 until it rests over his throat; he shudders, and turns on
his<br>
 straw; he raises his arm from his throat, and feebly stretches
it<br>
 out; his hand clutches at the straw on the side toward which he
has<br>
 turned; he seems to fancy that he is grasping at the edge of<br>
 something. I see his lips begin to move again; I step softly
into<br>
 the stable; my wife follows me, with her hand fast clasped in
mine.<br>
 We both bend over him. He is talking once more in his
sleep--<br>
 strange talk, mad talk, this time.</p>

<p>"Light gray eyes" (we hear him say), "and a droop in the
left<br>
 eyelid--flaxen hair, with a gold-yellow streak in it--all
right,<br>
 mother! fair, white arms with a down on them--little, lady's
hand,<br>
 with a reddish look round the fingernails--the knife--the
cursed<br>
 knife--first on one side, then on the other--aha, you
she-devil!<br>
 where is the knife?"</p>

<p>He stops and grows restless on a sudden. We see him writhing
on<br>
 the straw. He throws up both his hands and gasps hysterically
for<br>
 breath. His eyes open suddenly. For a moment they look at<br>
 nothing, with a vacant glitter in them--then they close again
in<br>
 deeper sleep. Is he dreaming still? Yes; but the dream seems
to<br>
 have taken a new course. When he speaks next, the tone is
altered;<br>
 the words are few--sadly and imploringly repeated over and
over<br>
 again. "Say you love me! I am so fond of YOU. Say you love
me!<br>
 say you love me!" He sinks into deeper and deeper sleep,
faintly<br>
 repeating those words. They die away on his lips. He speaks
no<br>
 more.</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Fairbank has got over her terror; she is
devoured<br>
 by curiosity now. The miserable creature on the straw has
appealed<br>
 to the imaginative side of her character. Her illimitable
appetite<br>
 for romance hungers and thirsts for more. She shakes me<br>
 impatiently by the arm.</p>

<p>"Do you hear? There is a woman at the bottom of it, Percy!
There<br>
 is love and murder in it, Percy! Where are the people of the
inn?<br>
 Go into the yard, and call to them again."</p>

<p>My wife belongs, on her mother's side, to the South of France.
The<br>
 South of France breeds fine women with hot tempers. I say no
more.<br>
 Married men will understand my position. Single men may need to
be<br>
 told that there are occasions when we must not only love and
honor-<br>
 -we must also obey--our wives.</p>

<p>I turn to the door to obey MY wife, and find myself confronted
by a<br>
 stranger who has stolen on us unawares. The stranger is a
tiny,<br>
 sleepy, rosy old man, with a vacant pudding-face, and a
shining<br>
 bald head. He wears drab breeches and gaiters, and a
respectable<br>
 square-tailed ancient black coat. I feel instinctively that
here<br>
 is the landlord of the inn.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," says the rosy old man. "I'm a little hard
of<br>
 hearing. Was it you that was a-calling just now in the
yard?"</p>

<p>Before I can answer, my wife interposes. She insists (in a
shrill<br>
 voice, adapted to our host's hardness of hearing) on knowing
who<br>
 that unfortunate person is sleeping on the straw. "Where does
he<br>
 come from? Why does he say such dreadful things in his sleep?
Is<br>
 he married or single? Did he ever fall in love with a
murderess?<br>
 What sort of a looking woman was she? Did she really stab him
or<br>
 not? In short, dear Mr. Landlord, tell us the whole story!"</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Landlord waits drowsily until Mrs. Fairbank has
quite<br>
 done--then delivers himself of his reply as follows:</p>

<p>"His name's Francis Raven. He's an Independent Methodist. He
was<br>
 forty-five year old last birthday. And he's my hostler.
That's<br>
 his story."</p>

<p>My wife's hot southern temper finds its way to her foot,
and<br>
 expresses itself by a stamp on the stable yard.</p>

<p>The landlord turns himself sleepily round, and looks at the
horses.<br>
 "A fine pair of horses, them two in the yard. Do you want to
put<br>
 'em in my stables?" I reply in the affirmative by a nod. The<br>
 landlord, bent on making himself agreeable to my wife,
addresses<br>
 her once more. "I'm a-going to wake Francis Raven. He's an<br>
 Independent Methodist. He was forty-five year old last
birthday.<br>
 And he's my hostler. That's his story."</p>

<p>Having issued this second edition of his interesting
narrative, the<br>
 landlord enters the stable. We follow him to see how he will
wake<br>
 Francis Raven, and what will happen upon that. The stable
broom<br>
 stands in a corner; the landlord takes it--advances toward
the<br>
 sleeping hostler--and coolly stirs the man up with a broom as if
he<br>
 was a wild beast in a cage. Francis Raven starts to his feet
with<br>
 a cry of terror--looks at us wildly, with a horrid glare of<br>
 suspicion in his eyes--recovers himself the next moment--and<br>
 suddenly changes into a decent, quiet, respectable
serving-man.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, ma'am. I beg your pardon, sir."</p>

<p>The tone and manner in which he makes his apologies are both
above<br>
 his apparent station in life. I begin to catch the infection
of<br>
 Mrs. Fairbank's interest in this man. We both follow him out
into<br>
 the yard to see what he will do with the horses. The manner
in<br>
 which he lifts the injured leg of the lame horse tells me at
once<br>
 that he understands his business. Quickly and quietly, he
leads<br>
 the animal into an empty stable; quickly and quietly, he gets
a<br>
 bucket of hot water, and puts the lame horse's leg into it.
"The<br>
 warm water will reduce the swelling, sir. I will bandage the
leg<br>
 afterwards." All that he does is done intelligently; all that
he<br>
 says, he says to the purpose.</p>

<p>Nothing wild, nothing strange about him now. Is this the same
man<br>
 whom we heard talking in his sleep?--the same man who woke
with<br>
 that cry of terror and that horrid suspicion in his eyes? I<br>
 determine to try him with one or two questions.</p>

<h3><br>
 III</h3>

<p><br>
 "Not much to do here," I say to the hostler.</p>

<p>"Very little to do, sir," the hostler replies.</p>

<p>"Anybody staying in the house?"</p>

<p>"The house is quite empty, sir."</p>

<p>"I thought you were all dead. I could make nobody hear
me."</p>

<p>"The landlord is very deaf, sir, and the waiter is out on
an<br>
 errand."</p>

<p>"Yes; and YOU were fast asleep in the stable. Do you often
take a<br>
 nap in the daytime?"</p>

<p>The worn face of the hostler faintly flushes. His eyes look
away<br>
 from my eyes for the first time. Mrs. Fairbank furtively
pinches<br>
 my arm. Are we on the eve of a discovery at last? I repeat
my<br>
 question. The man has no civil alternative but to give me an<br>
 answer. The answer is given in these words:</p>

<p><br>
 "I was tired out, sir. You wouldn't have found me asleep in
the<br>
 daytime but for that."</p>

<p>"Tired out, eh? You had been hard at work, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"What was it, then?"</p>

<p>He hesitates again, and answers unwillingly, "I was up all
night."</p>

<p>"Up all night? Anything going on in the town?"</p>

<p>"Nothing going on, sir."</p>

<p>"Anybody ill?"</p>

<p>"Nobody ill, sir."</p>

<p>That reply is the last. Try as I may, I can extract nothing
more<br>
 from him. He turns away and busies himself in attending to
the<br>
 horse's leg. I leave the stable to speak to the landlord about
the<br>
 carriage which is to take us back to Farleigh Hall. Mrs.
Fairbank<br>
 remains with the hostler, and favors me with a look at
parting.<br>
 The look says plainly, "I mean to find out why he was up all
night.<br>
 Leave him to Me."</p>

<p>The ordering of the carriage is easily accomplished. The
inn<br>
 possesses one horse and one chaise. The landlord has a story
to<br>
 tell of the horse, and a story to tell of the chaise. They<br>
 resemble the story of Francis Raven--with this exception, that
the<br>
 horse and chaise belong to no religious persuasion. "The
horse<br>
 will be nine year old next birthday. I've had the shay for
four-<br>
 and-twenty year. Mr. Max, of Underbridge, he bred the horse;
and<br>
 Mr. Pooley, of Yeovil, he built the shay. It's my horse and
my<br>
 shay. And that's THEIR story!" Having relieved his mind of
these<br>
 details, the landlord proceeds to put the harness on the horse.
By<br>
 way of assisting him, I drag the chaise into the yard. Just as
our<br>
 preparations are completed, Mrs. Fairbank appears. A moment or
two<br>
 later the hostler follows her out. He has bandaged the
horse's<br>
 leg, and is now ready to drive us to Farleigh Hall. I
observe<br>
 signs of agitation in his face and manner, which suggest that
my<br>
 wife has found her way into his confidence. I put the question
to<br>
 her privately in a corner of the yard. "Well? Have you found
out<br>
 why Francis Raven was up all night?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairbank has an eye to dramatic effect. Instead of
answering<br>
 plainly, Yes or No, she suspends the interest and excites
the<br>
 audience by putting a question on her side.</p>

<p>"What is the day of the month, dear?"</p>

<p>"The day of the month is the first of March."</p>

<p>"The first of March, Percy, is Francis Raven's birthday."</p>

<p>I try to look as if I was interested--and don't succeed.</p>

<p>"Francis was born," Mrs. Fairbank proceeds gravely, "at two
o'clock<br>
 in the morning."</p>

<p>I begin to wonder whether my wife's intellect is going the way
of<br>
 the landlord's intellect. "Is that all?" I ask.</p>

<p>"It is NOT all," Mrs. Fairbank answers. "Francis Raven sits up
on<br>
 the morning of his birthday because he is afraid to go to
bed."</p>

<p>"And why is he afraid to go to bed?"</p>

<p>"Because he is in peril of his life."</p>

<p>"On his birthday?"</p>

<p>"On his birthday. At two o'clock in the morning. As regularly
as<br>
 the birthday comes round."</p>

<p>There she stops. Has she discovered no more than that? No
more<br>
 thus far. I begin to feel really interested by this time. I
ask<br>
 eagerly what it means? Mrs. Fairbank points mysteriously to
the<br>
 chaise--with Francis Raven (hitherto our hostler, now our
coachman)<br>
 waiting for us to get in. The chaise has a seat for two in
front,<br>
 and a seat for one behind. My wife casts a warning look at me,
and<br>
 places herself on the seat in front.</p>

<p>The necessary consequence of this arrangement is that Mrs.
Fairhank<br>
 sits by the side of the driver during a journey of two hours
and<br>
 more. Need I state the result? It would be an insult to your<br>
 intelligence to state the result. Let me offer you my place in
the<br>
 chaise. And let Francis Raven tell his terrible story in his
own<br>
 words.</p>

<h4><br>
 THE SECOND NARRATIVE</h4>

<h4>THE HOSTLER'S STORY.--TOLD BY HIMSELF</h4>

<h3><br>
 IV</h3>

<p><br>
 It is now ten years ago since I got my first warning of the
great<br>
 trouble of my life in the Vision of a Dream.</p>

<p>I shall be better able to tell you about it if you will
please<br>
 suppose yourselves to be drinking tea along with us in our
little<br>
 cottage in Cambridgeshire, ten years since.</p>

<p><br>
 The time was the close of day, and there were three of us at
the<br>
 table, namely, my mother, myself, and my mother's sister,
Mrs.<br>
 Chance. These two were Scotchwomen by birth, and both were
widows.<br>
 There was no other resemblance between them that I can call
to<br>
 mind. My mother had lived all her life in England, and had no
more<br>
 of the Scotch brogue on her tongue than I have. My aunt Chance
had<br>
 never been out of Scotland until she came to keep house with
my<br>
 mother after her husband's death. And when SHE opened her lips
you<br>
 heard broad Scotch, I can tell you, if you ever heard it
yet!</p>

<p>As it fell out, there was a matter of some consequence in
debate<br>
 among us that evening. It was this: whether I should do well
or<br>
 not to take a long journey on foot the next morning.</p>

<p>Now the next morning happened to be the day before my
birthday; and<br>
 the purpose of the journey was to offer myself for a situation
as<br>
 groom at a great house in the neighboring county to ours.
The<br>
 place was reported as likely to fall vacant in about three
weeks'<br>
 time. I was as well fitted to fill it as any other man. In
the<br>
 prosperous days of our family, my father had been manager of
a<br>
 training stable, and he had kept me employed among the horses
from<br>
 my boyhood upward. Please to excuse my troubling you with
these<br>
 small matters. They all fit into my story farther on, as you
will<br>
 soon find out. My poor mother was dead against my leaving home
on<br>
 the morrow.</p>

<p>"You can never walk all the way there and all the way back
again by<br>
 to-morrow night," she says. "The end of it will be that you
will<br>
 sleep away from home on your birthday. You have never done
that<br>
 yet, Francis, since your father's death, I don't like your doing
it<br>
 now. Wait a day longer, my son--only one day."</p>

<p>For my own part, I was weary of being idle, and I couldn't
abide<br>
 the notion of delay. Even one day might make all the
difference.<br>
 Some other man might take time by the forelock, and get the
place.</p>

<p>"Consider how long I have been out of work," I says, "and
don't ask<br>
 me to put off the journey. I won't fail you, mother. I'll
get<br>
 back by to-morrow night, if I have to pay my last sixpence for
a<br>
 lift in a cart."</p>

<p>My mother shook her head. "I don't like it, Francis--I don't
like<br>
 it!" There was no moving her from that view. We argued and<br>
 argued, until we were both at a deadlock. It ended in our
agreeing<br>
 to refer the difference between us to my mother's sister,
Mrs.<br>
 Chance.</p>

<p>While we were trying hard to convince each other, my aunt
Chance<br>
 sat as dumb as a fish, stirring her tea and thinking her own<br>
 thoughts. When we made our appeal to her, she seemed as it were
to<br>
 wake up. "Ye baith refer it to my puir judgment?" she says, in
her<br>
 broad Scotch. We both answered Yes. Upon that my aunt Chance<br>
 first cleared the tea-table, and then pulled out from the pocket
of<br>
 her gown a pack of cards.</p>

<p>Don't run away, if you please, with the notion that this was
done<br>
 lightly, with a view to amuse my mother and me. My aunt
Chance<br>
 seriously believed that she could look into the future by
telling<br>
 fortunes on the cards. She did nothing herself without first<br>
 consulting the cards. She could give no more serious proof of
her<br>
 interest in my welfare than the proof which she was offering
now.<br>
 I don't say it profanely; I only mention the fact--the cards
had,<br>
 in some incomprehensible way, got themselves jumbled up
together<br>
 with her religious convictions. You meet with people nowadays
who<br>
 believe in spirits working by way of tables and chairs. On
the<br>
 same principle (if there IS any principle in it) my aunt
Chance<br>
 believed in Providence working by way of the cards.</p>

<p>"Whether YOU are right, Francie, or your mither--whether ye
will do<br>
 weel or ill, the morrow, to go or stay--the cairds will tell
it.<br>
 We are a' in the hands of Proavidence. The cairds will tell
it."</p>

<p>Hearing this, my mother turned her head aside, with something
of a<br>
 sour look in her face. Her sister's notions about the cards
were<br>
 little better than flat blasphemy to her mind. But she kept
her<br>
 opinion to herself. My aunt Chance, to own the truth, had<br>
 inherited, through her late husband, a pension of thirty pounds
a<br>
 year. This was an important contribution to our housekeeping,
and<br>
 we poor relations were bound to treat her with a certain
respect.<br>
 As for myself, if my poor father never did anything else for
me<br>
 before he fell into difficulties, he gave me a good education,
and<br>
 raised me (thank God) above superstitions of all sorts. However,
a<br>
 very little amused me in those days; and I waited to have my<br>
 fortune told, as patiently as if I believed in it too!</p>

<p>My aunt began her hocus pocus by throwing out all the cards in
the<br>
 pack under seven. She shuffled the rest with her left hand
for<br>
 luck; and then she gave them to me to cut. "Wi' yer left
hand,<br>
 Francie. Mind that! Pet your trust in Proavidence--but dinna<br>
 forget that your luck's in yer left hand!" A long and
roundabout<br>
 shifting of the cards followed, reducing them in number until
there<br>
 were just fifteen of them left, laid out neatly before my aunt
in a<br>
 half circle. The card which happened to lie outermost, at
the<br>
 right-hand end of the circle, was, according to rule in such
cases,<br>
 the card chosen to represent Me. By way of being appropriate to
my<br>
 situation as a poor groom out of employment, the card was--the
King<br>
 of Diamonds.</p>

<p>"I tak' up the King o' Diamants," says my aunt. "I count
seven<br>
 cairds fra' richt to left; and I humbly ask a blessing on
what<br>
 follows." My aunt shut her eyes as if she was saying grace
before<br>
 meat, and held up to me the seventh card. I called the
seventh<br>
 card--the Queen of Spades. My aunt opened her eyes again in
a<br>
 hurry, and cast a sly look my way. "The Queen o' Spades means
a<br>
 dairk woman. Ye'll be thinking in secret, Francie, of a
dairk<br>
 woman?"</p>

<p>When a man has been out of work for more than three months,
his<br>
 mind isn't troubled much with thinking of women--light or dark.
I<br>
 was thinking of the groom's place at the great house, and I
tried<br>
 to say so. My aunt Chance wouldn't listen. She treated my<br>
 interpretation with contempt. "Hoot-toot! there's the caird
in<br>
 your hand! If ye're no thinking of her the day, ye'll be
thinking<br>
 of her the morrow. Where's the harm of thinking of a dairk
woman!<br>
 I was ance a dairk woman myself, before my hair was gray. Haud
yer<br>
 peace, Francie, and watch the cairds."</p>

<p>I watched the cards as I was told. There were seven left on
the<br>
 table. My aunt removed two from one end of the row and two
from<br>
 the other, and desired me to call the two outermost of the
three<br>
 cards now left on the table. I called the Ace of Clubs and the
Ten<br>
 of Diamonds. My aunt Chance lifted her eyes to the ceiling with
a<br>
 look of devout gratitude which sorely tried my mother's
patience.<br>
 The Ace of Clubs and the Ten of Diamonds, taken together,<br>
 signified--first, good news (evidently the news of the
groom's<br>
 place); secondly, a journey that lay before me (pointing plainly
to<br>
 my journey to-morrow!); thirdly and lastly, a sum of money<br>
 (probably the groom's wages!) waiting to find its way into
my<br>
 pockets. Having told my fortune in these encouraging terms,
my<br>
 aunt declined to carry the experiment any further. "Eh, lad!
it's<br>
 a clean tempting o' Proavidence to ask mair o' the cairds than
the<br>
 cairds have tauld us noo. Gae yer ways to-morrow to the
great<br>
 hoose. A dairk woman will meet ye at the gate; and she'll have
a<br>
 hand in getting ye the groom's place, wi' a' the gratifications
and<br>
 pairquisites appertaining to the same. And, mebbe, when yer<br>
 poaket's full o' money, ye'll no' be forgetting yer aunt
Chance,<br>
 maintaining her ain unblemished widowhood--wi' Proavidence<br>
 assisting--on thratty punds a year!"</p>

<p>I promised to remember my aunt Chance (who had the defect, by
the<br>
 way, of being a terribly greedy person after money) on the
next<br>
 happy occasion when my poor empty pockets were to be filled
at<br>
 last. This done, I looked at my mother. She had agreed to
take<br>
 her sister for umpire between us, and her sister had given it in
my<br>
 favor. She raised no more objections. Silently, she got on
her<br>
 feet, and kissed me, and sighed bitterly--and so left the room.
My<br>
 aunt Chance shook her head. "I doubt, Francie, yer puir mither
has<br>
 but a heathen notion of the vairtue of the cairds!"</p>

<p>By daylight the next morning I set forth on my journey. I
looked<br>
 back at the cottage as I opened the garden gate. At one window
was<br>
 my mother, with her handkerchief to her eyes. At the other
stood<br>
 my aunt Chance, holding up the Queen of Spades by way of<br>
 encouraging me at starting. I waved my hands to both of them
in<br>
 token of farewell, and stepped out briskly into the road. It
was<br>
 then the last day of February. Be pleased to remember, in<br>
 connection with this, that the first of March was the day, and
two<br>
 o'clock in the morning the hour of my birth.</p>

<h3><br>
 V</h3>

<p><br>
 Now you know how I came to leave home. The next thing to tell
is,<br>
 what happened on the journey.</p>

<p>I reached the great house in reasonably good time considering
the<br>
 distance. At the very first trial of it, the prophecy of the
cards<br>
 turned out to be wrong. The person who met me at the lodge
gate<br>
 was not a dark woman--in fact, not a woman at all--but a boy.
He<br>
 directed me on the way to the servants' offices; and there
again<br>
 the cards were all wrong. I encountered, not one woman, but
three-<br>
 -and not one of the three was dark. I have stated that I am
not<br>
 superstitious, and I have told the truth. But I must own that
I<br>
 did feel a certain fluttering at the heart when I made my bow
to<br>
 the steward, and told him what business had brought me to
the<br>
 house. His answer completed the discomfiture of aunt
Chance's<br>
 fortune-telling. My ill-luck still pursued me. That very
morning<br>
 another man had applied for the groom's place, and had got
it.</p>

<p><br>
 I swallowed my disappointment as well as I could, and thanked
the<br>
 steward, and went to the inn in the village to get the rest
and<br>
 food which I sorely needed by this time.</p>

<p>Before starting on my homeward walk I made some inquiries at
the<br>
 inn, and ascertained that I might save a few miles, on my
return,<br>
 by following a new road. Furnished with full instructions,
several<br>
 times repeated, as to the various turnings I was to take, I
set<br>
 forth, and walked on till the evening with only one stoppage
for<br>
 bread and cheese. Just as it was getting toward dark, the
rain<br>
 came on and the wind began to rise; and I found myself, to
make<br>
 matters worse, in a part of the country with which I was
entirely<br>
 unacquainted, though I guessed myself to be some fifteen miles
from<br>
 home. The first house I found to inquire at, was a lonely
roadside<br>
 inn, standing on the outskirts of a thick wood. Solitary as
the<br>
 place looked, it was welcome to a lost man who was also
hungry,<br>
 thirsty, footsore, and wet. The landlord was civil and<br>
 respectable-looking; and the price he asked for a bed was<br>
 reasonable enough. I was grieved to disappoint my mother.
But<br>
 there was no conveyance to be had, and I could go no farther
afoot<br>
 that night. My weariness fairly forced me to stop at the
inn.</p>

<p>I may say for myself that I am a temperate man. My supper
simply<br>
 consisted of some rashers of bacon, a slice of home-made bread,
and<br>
 a pint of ale. I did not go to bed immediately after this
moderate<br>
 meal, but sat up with the landlord, talking about my bad
prospects<br>
 and my long run of ill-luck, and diverging from these topics to
the<br>
 subjects of horse-flesh and racing. Nothing was said, either
by<br>
 myself, my host, or the few laborers who strayed into the
tap-room,<br>
 which could, in the slightest degree, excite my mind, or set
my<br>
 fancy--which is only a small fancy at the best of
times--playing<br>
 tricks with my common sense.</p>

<p>At a little after eleven the house was closed. I went round
with<br>
 the landlord, and held the candle while the doors and lower
windows<br>
 were being secured. I noticed with surprise the strength of
the<br>
 bolts, bars, and iron-sheathed shutters.</p>

<p>"You see, we are rather lonely here," said the landlord. "We
never<br>
 have had any attempts to break in yet, but it's always as well
to<br>
 be on the safe side. When nobody is sleeping here, I am the
only<br>
 man in the house. My wife and daughter are timid, and the
servant<br>
 girl takes after her missuses. Another glass of ale, before
you<br>
 turn in?--No!--Well, how such a sober man as you comes to be out
of<br>
 a place is more than I can understand for one.--Here's where
you're<br>
 to sleep. You're the only lodger to-night, and I think you'll
say<br>
 my missus has done her best to make you comfortable. You're
quite<br>
 sure you won't have another glass of ale?--Very well. Good
night."</p>

<p>It was half-past eleven by the clock in the passage as we
went<br>
 upstairs to the bedroom. The window looked out on the wood at
the<br>
 back of the house.</p>

<p>I locked my door, set my candle on the chest of drawers,
and<br>
 wearily got me ready for bed. The bleak wind was still
blowing,<br>
 and the solemn, surging moan of it in the wood was very dreary
to<br>
 hear through the night silence. Feeling strangely wakeful, I<br>
 resolved to keep the candle alight until I began to grow
sleepy.<br>
 The truth is, I was not quite myself. I was depressed in mind
by<br>
 my disappointment of the morning; and I was worn out in body by
my<br>
 long walk. Between the two, I own I couldn't face the prospect
of<br>
 lying awake in the darkness, listening to the dismal moan of
the<br>
 wind in the wood.</p>

<p>Sleep stole on me before I was aware of it; my eyes closed,
and I<br>
 fell off to rest, without having so much as thought of<br>
 extinguishing the candle.</p>

<p>The next thing that I remember was a faint shivering that
ran<br>
 through me from head to foot, and a dreadful sinking pain at
my<br>
 heart, such as I had never felt before. The shivering only<br>
 disturbed my slumbers--the pain woke me instantly. In one moment
I<br>
 passed from a state of sleep to a state of wakefulness--my
eyes<br>
 wide open--my mind clear on a sudden as if by a miracle. The<br>
 candle had burned down nearly to the last morsel of tallow, but
the<br>
 unsnuffed wick had just fallen off, and the light was, for
the<br>
 moment, fair and full.</p>

<p>Between the foot of the bed and the closet door, I saw a
person in<br>
 my room. The person was a woman, standing looking at me, with
a<br>
 knife in her hand. It does no credit to my courage to confess
it--<br>
 but the truth IS the truth. I was struck speechless with
terror.<br>
 There I lay with my eyes on the woman; there the woman stood
(with<br>
 the knife in her hand) with HER eyes on ME.</p>

<p>She said not a word as we stared each other in the face; but
she<br>
 moved after a little--moved slowly toward the left-hand side of
the<br>
 bed.</p>

<p>The light fell full on her face. A fair, fine woman, with<br>
 yellowish flaxen hair, and light gray eyes, with a droop in
the<br>
 left eyelid. I noticed these things and fixed them in my
mind,<br>
 before she was quite round at the side of the bed. Without
saying<br>
 a word; without any change in the stony stillness of her
face;<br>
 without any noise following her footfall, she came closer
and<br>
 closer; stopped at the bed-head; and lifted the knife to stab
me.<br>
 I laid my arm over my throat to save it; but, as I saw the
blow<br>
 coming, I threw my hand across the bed to the right side,
and<br>
 jerked my body over that way, just as the knife came down,
like<br>
 lightning, within a hair's breadth of my shoulder.</p>

<p>My eyes fixed on her arm and her hand--she gave me time to
look at<br>
 them as she slowly drew the knife out of the bed. A white,
well-<br>
 shaped arm, with a pretty down lying lightly over the fair skin.
A<br>
 delicate lady's hand, with a pink flush round the finger
nails.</p>

<p>She drew the knife out, and passed back again slowly to the
foot of<br>
 the bed; she stopped there for a moment looking at me; then
she<br>
 came on without saying a word; without any change in the
stony<br>
 stillness of her face; without any noise following her
footfall--<br>
 came on to the side of the bed where I now lay.</p>

<p>Getting near me, she lifted the knife again, and I drew myself
away<br>
 to the left side. She struck, as before right into the
mattress,<br>
 with a swift downward action of her arm; and she missed me,
as<br>
 before; by a hair's breadth. This time my eyes wandered from
HER<br>
 to the knife. It was like the large clasp knives which
laboring<br>
 men use to cut their bread and bacon with. Her delicate
little<br>
 fingers did not hide more than two thirds of the handle; I
noticed<br>
 that it was made of buckhorn, clean and shining as the blade
was,<br>
 and looking like new.</p>

<p>For the second time she drew the knife out of the bed, and
suddenly<br>
 hid it away in the wide sleeve of her gown. That done, she
stopped<br>
 by the bedside watching me. For an instant I saw her standing
in<br>
 that position--then the wick of the spent candle fell over into
the<br>
 socket. The flame dwindled to a little blue point, and the
room<br>
 grew dark.</p>

<p>A moment, or less, if possible, passed so--and then the wick
flared<br>
 up, smokily, for the last time. My eyes were still looking for
her<br>
 over the right-hand side of the bed when the last flash of
light<br>
 came. Look as I might, I could see nothing. The woman with
the<br>
 knife was gone.</p>

<p>I began to get back to myself again. I could feel my heart<br>
 beating; I could hear the woeful moaning of the wind in the
wood; I<br>
 could leap up in bed, and give the alarm before she escaped
from<br>
 the house. "Murder! Wake up there! Murder!"</p>

<p>Nobody answered to the alarm. I rose and groped my way through
the<br>
 darkness to the door of the room. By that way she must have
got<br>
 in. By that way she must have gone out.</p>

<p>The door of the room was fast locked, exactly as I had left it
on<br>
 going to bed! I looked at the window. Fast locked too!</p>

<p>Hearing a voice outside, I opened the door. There was the<br>
 landlord, coming toward me along the passage, with his
burning<br>
 candle in one hand, and his gun in the other.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he says, looking at me in no very friendly
way.</p>

<p>I could only answer in a whisper, "A woman, with a knife in
her<br>
 hand. In my room. A fair, yellow-haired woman. She jabbed at
me<br>
 with the knife, twice over."</p>

<p>He lifted his candle, and looked at me steadily from head to
foot.<br>
 "She seems to have missed you--twice over."</p>

<p>"I dodged the knife as it came down. It struck the bed each
time.<br>
 Go in, and see."</p>

<p>The landlord took his candle into the bedroom immediately. In
less<br>
 than a minute he came out again into the passage in a
violent<br>
 passion.</p>

<p>"The devil fly away with you and your woman with the knife!
There<br>
 isn't a mark in the bedclothes anywhere. What do you mean by<br>
 coming into a man's place and frightening his family out of
their<br>
 wits by a dream?"</p>

<p>A dream? The woman who had tried to stab me, not a living
human<br>
 being like myself? I began to shake and shiver. The horrors
got<br>
 hold of me at the bare thought of it.</p>

<p>"I'll leave the house," I said. "Better be out on the road in
the<br>
 rain and dark, than back in that room, after what I've seen in
it.<br>
 Lend me the light to get my clothes by, and tell me what I'm
to<br>
 pay."</p>

<p>The landlord led the way back with his light into the
bedroom.<br>
 "Pay?" says he. "You'll find your score on the slate when you
go<br>
 downstairs. I wouldn't have taken you in for all the money
you've<br>
 got about you, if I had known your dreaming, screeching ways<br>
 beforehand. Look at the bed--where's the cut of a knife in
it?<br>
 Look at the window--is the lock bursted? Look at the door (which
I<br>
 heard you fasten yourself)--is it broke in? A murdering woman
with<br>
 a knife in my house! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!"</p>

<p>My eyes followed his hand as it pointed first to the bed--then
to<br>
 the window--then to the door. There was no gainsaying it. The
bed<br>
 sheet was as sound as on the day it was made. The window was
fast.<br>
 The door hung on its hinges as steady as ever. I huddled my<br>
 clothes on without speaking. We went downstairs together. I<br>
 looked at the clock in the bar-room. The time was twenty
minutes<br>
 past two in the morning. I paid my bill, and the landlord let
me<br>
 out. The rain had ceased; but the night was dark, and the wind
was<br>
 bleaker than ever. Little did the darkness, or the cold, or
the<br>
 doubt about the way home matter to ME. My mind was away from
all<br>
 these things. My mind was fixed on the vision in the
bedroom.<br>
 What had I seen trying to murder me? The creature of a dream?
Or<br>
 that other creature from the world beyond the grave, whom men
call<br>
 ghost? I could make nothing of it as I walked along in the
night;<br>
 I had made nothing by it by midday--when I stood at last,
after<br>
 many times missing my road, on the doorstep of home.</p>

<h3><br>
 VI</h3>

<p><br>
 My mother came out alone to welcome me back. There were no
secrets<br>
 between us two. I told her all that had happened, just as I
have<br>
 told it to you. She kept silence till I had done. And then
she<br>
 put a question to me.</p>

<p>"What time was it, Francis, when you saw the Woman in your
Dream?"</p>

<p>I had looked at the clock when I left the inn, and I had
noticed<br>
 that the hands pointed to twenty minutes past two. Allowing
for<br>
 the time consumed in speaking to the landlord, and in getting on
my<br>
 clothes, I answered that I must have first seen the Woman at
two<br>
 o'clock in the morning. In other words, I had not only seen her
on<br>
 my birthday, but at the hour of my birth.</p>

<p><br>
 My mother still kept silence. Lost in her own thoughts, she
took<br>
 me by the hand, and led me into the parlor. Her writing-desk
was<br>
 on the table by the fireplace. She opened it, and signed to me
to<br>
 take a chair by her side.</p>

<p>"My son! your memory is a bad one, and mine is fast failing
me.<br>
 Tell me again what the Woman looked like. I want her to be as
well<br>
 known to both of us, years hence, as she is now."</p>

<p>I obeyed; wondering what strange fancy might be working in
her<br>
 mind. I spoke; and she wrote the words as they fell from my
lips:</p>

<p>"Light gray eyes, with a droop in the left eyelid. Flaxen
hair,<br>
 with a golden-yellow streak in it. White arms, with a down
upon<br>
 them. Little, lady's hands, with a rosy-red look about the
finger<br>
 nails."</p>

<p>"Did you notice how she was dressed, Francis?"</p>

<p>"No, mother."</p>

<p>"Did you notice the knife?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A large clasp knife, with a buckhorn handle, as good
as<br>
 new."</p>

<p>My mother added the description of the knife. Also the
year,<br>
 month, day of the week, and hour of the day when the
Dream-Woman<br>
 appeared to me at the inn. That done, she locked up the paper
in<br>
 her desk.</p>

<p>"Not a word, Francis, to your aunt. Not a word to any living
soul.<br>
 Keep your Dream a secret between you and me."</p>

<p>The weeks passed, and the months passed. My mother never
returned<br>
 to the subject again. As for me, time, which wears out all
things,<br>
 wore out my remembrance of the Dream. Little by little, the
image<br>
 of the Woman grew dimmer and dimmer. Little by little, she
faded<br>
 out of my mind.</p>

<h3><br>
 VII</h3>

<p><br>
 The story of the warning is now told. Judge for yourself if it
was<br>
 a true warning or a false, when you hear what happened to me on
my<br>
 next birthday.</p>

<p>In the Summer time of the year, the Wheel of Fortune turned
the<br>
 right way for me at last. I was smoking my pipe one day, near
an<br>
 old stone quarry at the entrance to our village, when a
carriage<br>
 accident happened, which gave a new turn, as it were, to my lot
in<br>
 life. It was an accident of the commonest kind--not worth<br>
 mentioning at any length. A lady driving herself; a runaway
horse;<br>
 a cowardly man-servant in attendance, frightened out of his
wits;<br>
 and the stone quarry too near to be agreeable--that is what I
saw,<br>
 all in a few moments, between two whiffs of my pipe. I stopped
the<br>
 horse at the edge of the quarry, and got myself a little hurt
by<br>
 the shaft of the chaise. But that didn't matter. The lady<br>
 declared I had saved her life; and her husband, coming with her
to<br>
 our cottage the next day, took me into his service then and
there.<br>
 The lady happened to be of a dark complexion; and it may amuse
you<br>
 to hear that my aunt Chance instantly pitched on that
circumstance<br>
 as a means of saving the credit of the cards. Here was the
promise<br>
 of the Queen of Spades performed to the very letter, by means of
"a<br>
 dark woman," just as my aunt had told me. "In the time to
come,<br>
 Francis, beware o' pettin' yer ain blinded intairpretation on
the<br>
 cairds. Ye're ower ready, I trow, to murmur under dispensation
of<br>
 Proavidence that ye canna fathom--like the Eesraelites of
auld.<br>
 I'll say nae mair to ye. Mebbe when the mony's powering into
yer<br>
 poakets, ye'll no forget yer aunt Chance, left like a sparrow
on<br>
 the housetop, wi a sma' annuitee o' thratty punds a year."</p>

<p><br>
 I remained in my situation (at the West-end of London) until
the<br>
 Spring of the New Year. About that time, my master's health<br>
 failed. The doctors ordered him away to foreign parts, and
the<br>
 establishment was broken up. But the turn in my luck still
held<br>
 good. When I left my place, I left it--thanks to the generosity
of<br>
 my kind master--with a yearly allowance granted to me, in<br>
 remembrance of the day when I had saved my mistress's life.
For<br>
 the future, I could go back to service or not, as I pleased;
my<br>
 little income was enough to support my mother and myself.</p>

<p>My master and mistress left England toward the end of
February.<br>
 Certain matters of business to do for them detained me in
London<br>
 until the last day of the month. I was only able to leave for
our<br>
 village by the evening train, to keep my birthday with my mother
as<br>
 usual. It was bedtime when I got to the cottage; and I was
sorry<br>
 to find that she was far from well. To make matters worse, she
had<br>
 finished her bottle of medicine on the previous day, and had<br>
 omitted to get it replenished, as the doctor had strictly
directed.<br>
 He dispensed his own medicines, and I offered to go and knock
him<br>
 up. She refused to let me do this; and, after giving me my
supper,<br>
 sent me away to my bed.</p>

<p>I fell asleep for a little, and woke again. My mother's
bed-<br>
 chamber was next to mine. I heard my aunt Chance's heavy
footsteps<br>
 going to and fro in the room, and, suspecting something
wrong,<br>
 knocked at the door. My mother's pains had returned upon
her;<br>
 there was a serious necessity for relieving her sufferings
as<br>
 speedily as possible, I put on my clothes, and ran off, with
the<br>
 medicine bottle in my hand, to the other end of the village,
where<br>
 the doctor lived. The church clock chimed the quarter to two on
my<br>
 birthday just as I reached his house. One ring of the night
bell<br>
 brought him to his bedroom window to speak to me. He told me
to<br>
 wait, and he would let me in at the surgery door. I noticed,
while<br>
 I was waiting, that the night was wonderfully fair and warm for
the<br>
 time of year. The old stone quarry where the carriage accident
had<br>
 happened was within view. The moon in the clear heavens lit it
up<br>
 almost as bright as day.</p>

<p>In a minute or two the doctor let me into the surgery. I
closed<br>
 the door, noticing that he had left his room very lightly clad.
He<br>
 kindly pardoned my mother's neglect of his directions, and set
to<br>
 work at once at compounding the medicine. We were both intent
on<br>
 the bottle; he filling it, and I holding the light--when we
heard<br>
 the surgery door suddenly opened from the street.</p>

<h3><br>
 VIII</h3>

<p><br>
 Who could possibly be up and about in our quiet village at
the<br>
 second hour of the morning?</p>

<p>The person who opened the door appeared within range of the
light<br>
 of the candle. To complete our amazement, the person proved to
be<br>
 a woman! She walked up to the counter, and standing side by
side<br>
 with me, lifted her veil. At the moment when she showed her
face,<br>
 I heard the church clock strike two. She was a stranger to me,
and<br>
 a stranger to the doctor. She was also, beyond all comparison,
the<br>
 most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life.</p>

<p>"I saw the light under the door," she said. "I want some<br>
 medicine."</p>

<p><br>
 She spoke quite composedly, as if there was nothing at all<br>
 extraordinary in her being out in the village at two in the<br>
 morning, and following me into the surgery to ask for
medicine!<br>
 The doctor stared at her as if he suspected his own eyes of<br>
 deceiving him. "Who are you?" be asked. "How do you come to
be<br>
 wandering about at this time in the morning?"</p>

<p>She paid no heed to his questions. She only told him coolly
what<br>
 she wanted. "I have got a bad toothache. I want a bottle of<br>
 laudanum."</p>

<p>The doctor recovered himself when she asked for the laudanum.
He<br>
 was on his own ground, you know, when it came to a matter of<br>
 laudanum; and he spoke to her smartly enough this time.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have got the toothache, have you? Let me look at
the<br>
 tooth."</p>

<p>She shook her bead, and laid a two-shilling piece on the
counter.<br>
 "I won't trouble you to look at the tooth," she said. "There
is<br>
 the money. Let me have the laudanum, if you please."</p>

<p>The doctor put the two-shilling piece back again in her hand.
"I<br>
 don't sell laudanum to strangers," he answered. "If you are in
any<br>
 distress of body or mind, that is another matter. I shall be
glad<br>
 to help you."</p>

<p>She put the money back in her pocket. "YOU can't help me,"
she<br>
 said, as quietly as ever. "Good morning."</p>

<p>With that, she opened the surgery door to go out again into
the<br>
 street. So far, I had not spoken a word on my side. I had
stood<br>
 with the candle in my hand (not knowing I was holding it)--with
my<br>
 eyes fixed on her, with my mind fixed on her like a man
bewitched.<br>
 Her looks betrayed, even more plainly than her words, her<br>
 resolution, in one way or another, to destroy herself. When
she<br>
 opened the door, in my alarm at what might happen I found the
use<br>
 of my tongue.</p>

<p>"Stop!" I cried out. "Wait for me. I want to speak to you
before<br>
 you go away." She lifted her eyes with a look of careless
surprise<br>
 and a mocking smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"What can YOU have to say to me?" She stopped, and laughed
to<br>
 herself. "Why not?" she said. "I have got nothing to do, and<br>
 nowhere to go." She turned back a step, and nodded to me.
"You're<br>
 a strange man--I think I'll humor you--I'll wait outside."
The<br>
 door of the surgery closed on her. She was gone.</p>

<p>I am ashamed to own what happened next. The only excuse for me
is<br>
 that I was really and truly a man bewitched. I turned me round
to<br>
 follow her out, without once thinking of my mother. The
doctor<br>
 stopped me.</p>

<p>"Don't forget the medicine," he said. "And if you will take
my<br>
 advice, don't trouble yourself about that woman. Rouse up
the<br>
 constable. It's his business to look after her--not yours."</p>

<p>I held out my hand for the medicine in silence: I was afraid
I<br>
 should fail in respect if I trusted myself to answer him. He
must<br>
 have seen, as I saw, that she wanted the laudanum to poison<br>
 herself. He had, to my mind, taken a very heartless view of
the<br>
 matter. I just thanked him when he gave me the medicine--and
went<br>
 out.</p>

<p>She was waiting for me as she had promised; walking slowly to
and<br>
 fro--a tall, graceful, solitary figure in the bright
moonbeams.<br>
 They shed over her fair complexion, her bright golden hair,
her<br>
 large gray eyes, just the light that suited them best. She
looked<br>
 hardly mortal when she first turned to speak to me.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said. "And what do you want?"</p>

<p>In spite of my pride, or my shyness, or my better
sense--whichever<br>
 it might be--all my heart went out to her in a moment. I
caught<br>
 hold of her by the hands, and owned what was in my thoughts,
as<br>
 freely as if I had known her for half a lifetime.</p>

<p>"You mean to destroy yourself," I said. "And I mean to prevent
you<br>
 from doing it. If I follow you about all night, I'll prevent
you<br>
 from doing it."</p>

<p>She laughed. "You saw yourself that he wouldn't sell me
the<br>
 laudanum. Do you really care whether I live or die?" She
squeezed<br>
 my hands gently as she put the question: her eyes searched
mine<br>
 with a languid, lingering look in them that ran through me
like<br>
 fire. My voice died away on my lips; I couldn't answer her.</p>

<p>She understood, without my answering. "You have given me a
fancy<br>
 for living, by speaking kindly to me," she said. "Kindness has
a<br>
 wonderful effect on women, and dogs, and other domestic
animals.<br>
 It is only men who are superior to kindness. Make your mind
easy--<br>
 I promise to take as much care of myself as if I was the
happiest<br>
 woman living! Don't let me keep you here, out of your bed.
Which<br>
 way are you going?"</p>

<p>Miserable wretch that I was, I had forgotten my mother--with
the<br>
 medicine in my hand! "I am going home," I said. "Where are
you<br>
 staying? At the inn?"</p>

<p>She laughed her bitter laugh, and pointed to the stone
quarry.<br>
 "There is MY inn for to-night," she said. "When I got tired
of<br>
 walking about, I rested there."</p>

<p>We walked on together, on my way home. I took the liberty
of<br>
 asking her if she had any friends.</p>

<p>"I thought I had one friend left," she said, "or you would
never<br>
 have met me in this place. It turns out I was wrong. My
friend's<br>
 door was closed in my face some hours since; my friend's
servants<br>
 threatened me with the police. I had nowhere else to go,
after<br>
 trying my luck in your neighborhood; and nothing left but my
two-<br>
 shilling piece and these rags on my back. What respectable<br>
 innkeeper would take ME into his house? I walked about,
wondering<br>
 how I could find my way out of the world without disfiguring<br>
 myself, and without suffering much pain. You have no river
in<br>
 these parts. I didn't see my way out of the world, till I
heard<br>
 you ringing at the doctor's house. I got a glimpse at the
bottles<br>
 in the surgery, when he let you in, and I thought of the
laudanum<br>
 directly. What were you doing there? Who is that medicine
for?<br>
 Your wife?"</p>

<p>"I am not married!"</p>

<p>She laughed again. "Not married! If I was a little better
dressed<br>
 there might be a chance for ME. Where do you live? Here?"</p>

<p>We had arrived, by this time, at my mother's door. She held
out<br>
 her hand to say good-by. Houseless and homeless as she was,
she<br>
 never asked me to give her a shelter for the night. It was
MY<br>
 proposal that she should rest, under my roof, unknown to my
mother<br>
 and my aunt. Our kitchen was built out at the back of the
cottage:<br>
 she might remain there unseen and unheard until the household
was<br>
 astir in the morning. I led her into the kitchen, and set a
chair<br>
 for her by the dying embers of the fire. I dare say I was to<br>
 blame--shamefully to blame, if you like. I only wonder what
YOU<br>
 would have done in my place. On your word of honor as a man,
would<br>
 YOU have let that beautiful creature wander back to the shelter
of<br>
 the stone quarry like a stray dog? God help the woman who is<br>
 foolish enough to trust and love you, if you would have done
that!</p>

<p>I left her by the fire, and went to my mother's room.</p>

<h3><br>
 IX</h3>

<p><br>
 If you have ever felt the heartache, you will know what I
suffered<br>
 in secret when my mother took my hand, and said, "I am
sorry,<br>
 Francis, that your night's rest has been disturbed through ME."
I<br>
 gave her the medicine; and I waited by her till the pains
abated.<br>
 My aunt Chance went back to her bed; and my mother and I were
left<br>
 alone. I noticed that her writing-desk, moved from its
customary<br>
 place, was on the bed by her side. She saw me looking at it.<br>
 "This is your birthday, Francis," she said. "Have you anything
to<br>
 tell me?" I had so completely forgotten my Dream, that I had
no<br>
 notion of what was passing in her mind when she said those
words.<br>
 For a moment there was a guilty fear in me that she
suspected<br>
 something. I turned away my face, and said, "No, mother; I
have<br>
 nothing to tell." She signed to me to stoop down over the
pillow<br>
 and kiss her. "God bless you, my love!" she said; and many
happy<br>
 returns of the day." She patted my hand, and closed her
weary<br>
 eyes, and, little by little, fell off peaceably into sleep.</p>

<p><br>
 I stole downstairs again. I think the good influence of my
mother<br>
 must have followed me down. At any rate, this is true: I
stopped<br>
 with my hand on the closed kitchen door, and said to myself:<br>
 "Suppose I leave the house, and leave the village, without
seeing<br>
 her or speaking to her more?"</p>

<p>Should I really have fled from temptation in this way, if I
had<br>
 been left to myself to decide? Who can tell? As things were,
I<br>
 was not left to decide. While my doubt was in my mind, she
heard<br>
 me, and opened the kitchen door. My eyes and her eyes met.
That<br>
 ended it.</p>

<p>We were together, unsuspected and undisturbed, for the next
two<br>
 hours. Time enough for her to reveal the secret of her
wasted<br>
 life. Time enough for her to take possession of me as her own,
to<br>
 do with me as she liked. It is needless to dwell here on the<br>
 misfortunes which had brought her low; they are misfortunes
too<br>
 common to interest anybody.</p>

<p>Her name was Alicia Warlock. She had been born and bred a
lady.<br>
 She had lost her station, her character, and her friends.
Virtue<br>
 shuddered at the sight of her; and Vice had got her for the rest
of<br>
 her days. Shocking and common, as I told you. It made no<br>
 difference to ME. I have said it already--I say it again--I was
a<br>
 man bewitched. Is there anything so very wonderful in that?
Just<br>
 remember who I was. Among the honest women in my own station
in<br>
 life, where could I have found the like of HER? Could THEY walk
as<br>
 she walked? and look as she looked? When THEY gave me a kiss,
did<br>
 their lips linger over it as hers did? Had THEY her skin,
her<br>
 laugh, her foot, her hand, her touch? SHE never had a speck
of<br>
 dirt on her: I tell you her flesh was a perfume. When she
embraced<br>
 me, her arms folded round me like the wings of angels; and
her<br>
 smile covered me softly with its light like the sun in heaven.
I<br>
 leave you to laugh at me, or to cry over me, just as your
temper<br>
 may incline. I am not trying to excuse myself--I am trying
to<br>
 explain. You are gentle-folks; what dazzled and maddened ME,
is<br>
 everyday experience to YOU. Fallen or not, angel or devil, it
came<br>
 to this--she was a lady; and I was a groom.</p>

<p>Before the house was astir, I got her away (by the workmen's
train)<br>
 to a large manufacturing town in our parts.</p>

<p>Here--with my savings in money to help her--she could get
her<br>
 outfit of decent clothes and her lodging among strangers who
asked<br>
 no questions so long as they were paid. Here--now on one
pretense<br>
 and now on another--I could visit her, and we could both
plan<br>
 together what our future lives were to be. I need not tell
you<br>
 that I stood pledged to make her my wife. A man in my
station<br>
 always marries a woman of her sort.</p>

<p>Do you wonder if I was happy at this time? I should have
been<br>
 perfectly happy but for one little drawback. It was this: I
was<br>
 never quite at my ease in the presence of my promised wife.</p>

<p>I don't mean that I was shy with her, or suspicious of her,
or<br>
 ashamed of her. The uneasiness I am speaking of was caused by
a<br>
 faint doubt in my mind whether I had not seen her somewhere,
before<br>
 the morning when we met at the doctor's house. Over and over<br>
 again, I found myself wondering whether her face did not remind
me<br>
 of some other face--what other I never could tell. This
strange<br>
 feeling, this one question that could never be answered, vexed
me<br>
 to a degree that you would hardly credit. It came between us
at<br>
 the strangest times--oftenest, however, at night, when the
candles<br>
 were lit. You have known what it is to try and remember a<br>
 forgotten name--and to fail, search as you may, to find it in
your<br>
 mind. That was my case. I failed to find my lost face, just
as<br>
 you failed to find your lost name.</p>

<p>In three weeks we had talked matters over, and had arranged
how I<br>
 was to make a clean breast of it at home. By Alicia's advice,
I<br>
 was to describe her as having been one of my fellow servants
during<br>
 the time I was employed under my kind master and mistress in<br>
 London. There was no fear now of my mother taking any harm
from<br>
 the shock of a great surprise. Her health had improved during
the<br>
 three weeks' interval. On the first evening when she was able
to<br>
 take her old place at tea time, I summoned my courage, and told
her<br>
 I was going to be married. The poor soul flung her arms round
my<br>
 neck, and burst out crying for joy. "Oh, Francis!" she says, "I
am<br>
 so glad you will have somebody to comfort you and care for you
when<br>
 I am gone!" As for my aunt Chance, you can anticipate what
SHE<br>
 did, without being told. Ah, me! If there had really been
any<br>
 prophetic virtue in the cards, what a terrible warning they
might<br>
 have given us that night! It was arranged that I was to bring
my<br>
 promised wife to dinner at the cottage on the next day.</p>

<h3><br>
 X</h3>

<p><br>
 I own I was proud of Alicia when I led her into our little
parlor<br>
 at the appointed time. She had never, to my mind, looked so<br>
 beautiful as she looked that day. I never noticed any other<br>
 woman's dress--I noticed hers as carefully as if I had been a
woman<br>
 myself! She wore a black silk gown, with plain collar and
cuffs,<br>
 and a modest lavender-colored bonnet, with one white rose in
it<br>
 placed at the side. My mother, dressed in her Sunday best,
rose<br>
 up, all in a flutter, to welcome her daughter-in-law that was
to<br>
 be. She walked forward a few steps, half smiling, half in
tears--<br>
 she looked Alicia full in the face--and suddenly stood still.
Her<br>
 cheeks turned white in an instant; her eyes stared in horror;
her<br>
 hands dropped helplessly at her sides. She staggered back,
and<br>
 fell into the arms of my aunt, standing behind her. It was
no<br>
 swoon--she kept her senses. Her eyes turned slowly from Alicia
to<br>
 me. "Francis," she said, "does that woman's face remind you
of<br>
 nothing?"</p>

<p><br>
 Before I could answer, she pointed to her writing-desk on the
table<br>
 at the fireside. "Bring it!" she cried, "bring it!"</p>

<p>At the same moment I felt Alicia's hand on my shoulder, and
saw<br>
 Alicia's face red with anger--and no wonder!</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" she asked. "Does your mother want to
insult<br>
 me?"</p>

<p>I said a few words to quiet her; what they were I don't
remember--I<br>
 was so confused and astonished at the time. Before I had done,
I<br>
 heard my mother behind me.</p>

<p>My aunt had fetched her desk. She had opened it; she had taken
a<br>
 paper from it. Step by step, helping herself along by the
wall,<br>
 she came nearer and nearer, with the paper in her hand. She
looked<br>
 at the paper--she looked in Alicia's face--she lifted the
long,<br>
 loose sleeve of her gown, and examined her hand and arm. I
saw<br>
 fear suddenly take the place of anger in Alicia's eyes. She
shook<br>
 herself free of my mother's grasp. "Mad!" she said to
herself,<br>
 "and Francis never told me!" With those words she ran out of
the<br>
 room.</p>

<p>I was hastening out after her, when my mother signed to me to
stop.<br>
 She read the words written on the paper. While they fell
slowly,<br>
 one by one, from her lips, she pointed toward the open door.</p>

<p>"Light gray eyes, with a droop in the left eyelid. Flaxen
hair,<br>
 with a gold-yellow streak in it. White arms, with a down
upon<br>
 them. Little, lady's hand, with a rosy-red look about the
finger<br>
 nails. The Dream Woman, Francis! The Dream Woman!"</p>

<p>Something darkened the parlor window as those words were
spoken. I<br>
 looked sidelong at the shadow. Alicia Warlock had come back!
She<br>
 was peering in at us over the low window blind. There was
the<br>
 fatal face which had first looked at me in the bedroom of
the<br>
 lonely inn. There, resting on the window blind, was the
lovely<br>
 little hand which had held the murderous knife. I HAD seen
her<br>
 before we met in the village. The Dream Woman! The Dream
Woman!</p>

<h3><br>
 XI</h3>

<p><br>
 I expect nobody to approve of what I have next to tell of
myself.<br>
 In three weeks from the day when my mother had identified her
with<br>
 the Woman of the Dream, I took Alicia Warlock to church, and
made<br>
 her my wife. I was a man bewitched. Again and again I say
it--I<br>
 was a man bewitched!</p>

<p>During the interval before my marriage, our little household
at the<br>
 cottage was broken up. My mother and my aunt quarreled. My<br>
 mother, believing in the Dream, entreated me to break off my<br>
 engagement. My aunt, believing in the cards, urged me to
marry.</p>

<p>This difference of opinion produced a dispute between them, in
the<br>
 course of which my aunt Chance--quite unconscious of having
any<br>
 superstitious feelings of her own--actually set out the cards
which<br>
 prophesied happiness to me in my married life, and asked my
mother<br>
 how anybody but "a blinded heathen could be fule enough,
after<br>
 seeing those cairds, to believe in a dream!" This was,
naturally,<br>
 too much for my mother's patience; hard words followed on
either<br>
 side; Mrs. Chance returned in dudgeon to her friends in
Scotland.<br>
 She left me a written statement of my future prospects, as
revealed<br>
 by the cards, and with it an address at which a post-office
order<br>
 would reach her. "The day was not that far off," she
remarked,<br>
 "when Francie might remember what he owed to his aunt
Chance,<br>
 maintaining her ain unbleemished widowhood on thratty punds
a<br>
 year."</p>

<p><br>
 Having refused to give her sanction to my marriage, my mother
also<br>
 refused to be present at the wedding, or to visit Alicia<br>
 afterwards. There was no anger at the bottom of this conduct
on<br>
 her part. Believing as she did in this Dream, she was simply
in<br>
 mortal fear of my wife. I understood this, and I made
allowances<br>
 for her. Not a cross word passed between us. My one happy<br>
 remembrance now--though I did disobey her in the matter of
my<br>
 marriage--is this: I loved and respected my good mother to
the<br>
 last.</p>

<p>As for my wife, she expressed no regret at the estrangement
between<br>
 her mother-in-law and herself. By common consent, we never
spoke<br>
 on that subject. We settled in the manufacturing town which I
have<br>
 already mentioned, and we kept a lodging-house. My kind master,
at<br>
 my request, granted me a lump sum in place of my annuity. This
put<br>
 us into a good house, decently furnished. For a while things
went<br>
 well enough. I may describe myself at this time of my life as
a<br>
 happy man.</p>

<p>My misfortunes began with a return of the complaint with which
my<br>
 mother had already suffered. The doctor confessed, when I
asked<br>
 him the question, that there was danger to be dreaded this
time.<br>
 Naturally, after hearing this, I was a good deal away at the<br>
 cottage. Naturally also, I left the business of looking after
the<br>
 house, in my absence, to my wife. Little by little, I found
her<br>
 beginning to alter toward me. While my back was turned, she
formed<br>
 acquaintances with people of the doubtful and dissipated sort.
One<br>
 day, I observed something in her manner which forced the
suspicion<br>
 on me that she had been drinking. Before the week was out,
my<br>
 suspicion was a certainty. From keeping company with
drunkards,<br>
 she had grown to be a drunkard herself.</p>

<p>I did all a man could do to reclaim her. Quite useless! She
had<br>
 never really returned the love I felt for her: I had no
influence;<br>
 I could do nothing. My mother, hearing of this last worse
trouble,<br>
 resolved to try what her influence could do. Ill as she was,
I<br>
 found her one day dressed to go out.</p>

<p>"I am not long for this world, Francis," she said. "I shall
not<br>
 feel easy on my deathbed, unless I have done my best to the last
to<br>
 make you happy. I mean to put my own fears and my own feelings
out<br>
 of the question, and go with you to your wife, and try what I
can<br>
 do to reclaim her. Take me home with you, Francis. Let me do
all<br>
 I can to help my son, before it is too late."</p>

<p>How could I disobey her? We took the railway to the town: it
was<br>
 only half an hour's ride. By one o'clock in the afternoon we<br>
 reached my house. It was our dinner hour, and Alicia was in
the<br>
 kitchen. I was able to take my mother quietly into the parlor
and<br>
 then to prepare my wife for the visit. She had drunk but little
at<br>
 that early hour; and, luckily, the devil in her was tamed for
the<br>
 time.</p>

<p>She followed me into the parlor, and the meeting passed off
better<br>
 than I had ventured to forecast; with this one drawback, that
my<br>
 mother--though she tried hard to control herself--shrank
from<br>
 looking my wife in the face when she spoke to her. It was a
relief<br>
 to me when Alicia began to prepare the table for dinner.</p>

<p>She laid the cloth, brought in the bread tray, and cut some
slices<br>
 for us from the loaf. Then she returned to the kitchen. At
that<br>
 moment, while I was still anxiously watching my mother, I
was<br>
 startled by seeing the same ghastly change pass over her face
which<br>
 had altered it in the morning when Alicia and she first met.<br>
 Before I could say a word, she started up with a look of
horror.</p>

<p>"Take me back!--home, home again, Francis! Come with me, and
never<br>
 go back more!"</p>

<p>I was afraid to ask for an explanation; I could only sign her
to be<br>
 silent, and help her quickly to the door. As we passed the
bread<br>
 tray on the table, she stopped and pointed to it.</p>

<p>"Did you see what your wife cut your bread with?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No, mother; I was not noticing. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>I did look. A new clasp knife, with a buckhorn handle, lay
with<br>
 the loaf in the bread tray. I stretched out my hand to
possess<br>
 myself of it. At the same moment, there was a noise in the<br>
 kitchen, and my mother caught me by the arm.</p>

<p>"The knife of the Dream! Francis, I'm faint with fear--take
me<br>
 away before she comes back!"</p>

<p>I couldn't speak to comfort or even to answer her. Superior as
I<br>
 was to superstition, the discovery of the knife staggered me.
In<br>
 silence, I helped my mother out of the house; and took her
home.</p>

<p>I held out my hand to say good-by. She tried to stop me.</p>

<p>"Don't go back, Francis! don't go back!"</p>

<p>"I must get the knife, mother. I must go back by the next
train."<br>
 I held to that resolution. By the next train I went back.</p>

<h3><br>
 XII</h3>

<p><br>
 My wife had, of course, discovered our secret departure from
the<br>
 house. She had been drinking. She was in a fury of passion.
The<br>
 dinner in the kitchen was flung under the grate; the cloth was
off<br>
 the parlor table. Where was the knife?</p>

<p>I was foolish enough to ask for it. She refused to give it to
me.<br>
 In the course of the dispute between us which followed, I<br>
 discovered that there was a horrible story attached to the
knife.<br>
 It had been used in a murder--years since--and had been so<br>
 skillfully hidden that the authorities had been unable to
produce<br>
 it at the trial. By help of some of her disreputable friends,
my<br>
 wife had been able to purchase this relic of a bygone crime.
Her<br>
 perverted nature set some horrid unacknowledged value on the
knife.<br>
 Seeing there was no hope of getting it by fair means, I
determined<br>
 to search for it, later in the day, in secret. The search
was<br>
 unsuccessful. Night came on, and I left the house to walk
about<br>
 the streets. You will understand what a broken man I was by
this<br>
 time, when I tell you I was afraid to sleep in the same room
with<br>
 her!</p>

<p><br>
 Three weeks passed. Still she refused to give up the knife;
and<br>
 still that fear of sleeping in the same room with her possessed
me.<br>
 I walked about at night, or dozed in the parlor, or sat watching
by<br>
 my mother's bedside. Before the end of the first week in the
new<br>
 month, the worst misfortune of all befell me--my mother died.
It<br>
 wanted then but a short time to my birthday. She had longed
to<br>
 live till that day. I was present at her death. Her last words
in<br>
 this world were addressed to me. "Don't go back, my son--don't
go<br>
 back!"</p>

<p>I was obliged to go back, if it was only to watch my wife. In
the<br>
 last days of my mother's illness she had spitefully added a
sting<br>
 to my grief by declaring she would assert her right to attend
the<br>
 funeral. In spite of all that I could do or say, she held to
her<br>
 word. On the day appointed for the burial she forced
herself,<br>
 inflamed and shameless with drink, into my presence, and swore
she<br>
 would walk in the funeral procession to my mother's grave.</p>

<p>This last insult--after all I had gone through already--was
more<br>
 than I could endure. It maddened me. Try to make allowances for
a<br>
 man beside himself. I struck her.</p>

<p>The instant the blow was dealt, I repented it. She crouched
down,<br>
 silent, in a corner of the room, and eyed me steadily. It was
a<br>
 look that cooled my hot blood in an instant. There was no time
now<br>
 to think of making atonement. I could only risk the worst,
and<br>
 make sure of her till the funeral was over. I locked her into
her<br>
 bedroom.</p>

<p>When I came back, after laying my mother in the grave, I found
her<br>
 sitting by the bedside, very much altered in look and bearing,
with<br>
 a bundle on her lap. She faced me quietly; she spoke with a<br>
 curious stillness in her voice--strangely and unnaturally
composed<br>
 in look and manner.</p>

<p>"No man has ever struck me yet," she said. "My husband shall
have<br>
 no second opportunity. Set the door open, and let me go."</p>

<p>She passed me, and left the room. I saw her walk away up
the<br>
 street. Was she gone for good?</p>

<p>All that night I watched and waited. No footstep came near
the<br>
 house. The next night, overcome with fatigue, I lay down on
the<br>
 bed in my clothes, with the door locked, the key on the table,
and<br>
 the candle burning. My slumber was not disturbed. The third<br>
 night, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, passed, and nothing<br>
 happened. I lay down on the seventh night, still suspicious
of<br>
 something happening; still in my clothes; still with the
door<br>
 locked, the key on the table, and the candle burning.</p>

<p>My rest was disturbed. I awoke twice, without any sensation
of<br>
 uneasiness. The third time, that horrid shivering of the night
at<br>
 the lonely inn, that awful sinking pain at the heart, came
back<br>
 again, and roused me in an instant. My eyes turned to the
left-<br>
 hand side of the bed. And there stood, looking at me--</p>

<p>The Dream Woman again? No! My wife. The living woman, with
the<br>
 face of the Dream--in the attitude of the Dream--the fair arm
up;<br>
 the knife clasped in the delicate white hand.</p>

<p>I sprang upon her on the instant; but not quickly enough to
stop<br>
 her from hiding the knife. Without a word from me, without a
cry<br>
 from her, I pinioned her in a chair. With one hand I felt up
her<br>
 sleeve; and there, where the Dream Woman had hidden the knife,
my<br>
 wife had hidden it--the knife with the buckhorn handle, that
looked<br>
 like new.</p>

<p>What I felt when I made that discovery I could not realize at
the<br>
 time, and I can't describe now. I took one steady look at her
with<br>
 the knife in my hand. "You meant to kill me?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered; "I meant to kill you." She crossed her
arms<br>
 over her bosom, and stared me coolly in the face. "I shall do
it<br>
 yet," she said. "With that knife."</p>

<p>I don't know what possessed me--I swear to you I am no coward;
and<br>
 yet I acted like a coward. The horrors got hold of me. I
couldn't<br>
 look at her--I couldn't speak to her. I left her (with the
knife<br>
 in my hand), and went out into the night.</p>

<p>There was a bleak wind abroad, and the smell of rain was in
the<br>
 air. The church clocks chimed the quarter as I walked beyond
the<br>
 last house in the town. I asked the first policeman I met
what<br>
 hour that was, of which the quarter past had just struck.</p>

<p>The man looked at his watch, and answered, "Two o'clock." Two
in<br>
 the morning. What day of the month was this day that had
just<br>
 begun? I reckoned it up from the date of my mother's funeral.
The<br>
 horrid parallel between the dream and the reality was
complete--it<br>
 was my birthday!</p>

<p>Had I escaped the mortal peril which the dream foretold? or
had I<br>
 only received a second warning? As that doubt crossed my mind
I<br>
 stopped on my way out of the town. The air had revived me--I
felt<br>
 in some degree like my own self again. After a little thinking,
I<br>
 began to see plainly the mistake I had made in leaving my wife
free<br>
 to go where she liked and to do as she pleased.</p>

<p>I turned instantly, and made my way back to the house. It
was<br>
 still dark. I had left the candle burning in the bedchamber.
When<br>
 I looked up to the window of the room now, there was no light
in<br>
 it. I advanced to the house door. On going away, I remembered
to<br>
 have closed it; on trying it now, I found it open.</p>

<p>I waited outside, never losing sight of the house till
daylight.<br>
 Then I ventured indoors--listened, and heard nothing--looked
into<br>
 the kitchen, scullery, parlor, and found nothing--went up at
last<br>
 into the bedroom. It was empty.</p>

<p>A picklock lay on the floor, which told me how she had
gained<br>
 entrance in the night. And that was the one trace I could find
of<br>
 the Dream Woman.</p>

<h3><br>
 XIII</h3>

<p><br>
 I waited in the house till the town was astir for the day, and
then<br>
 I went to consult a lawyer. In the confused state of my mind
at<br>
 the time, I had one clear notion of what I meant to do: I
was<br>
 determined to sell my house and leave the neighborhood. There
were<br>
 obstacles in the way which I had not counted on. I was told I
had<br>
 creditors to satisfy before I could leave--I, who had given my
wife<br>
 the money to pay my bills regularly every week! Inquiry
showed<br>
 that she had embezzled every farthing of the money I had
intrusted<br>
 to her. I had no choice but to pay over again.</p>

<p><br>
 Placed in this awkward position, my first duty was to set
things<br>
 right, with the help of my lawyer. During my forced sojourn in
the<br>
 town I did two foolish things. And, as a consequence that<br>
 followed, I heard once more, and heard for the last time, of
my<br>
 wife.</p>

<p>In the first place, having got possession of the knife, I was
rash<br>
 enough to keep it in my pocket. In the second place, having<br>
 something of importance to say to my lawyer, at a late hour of
the<br>
 evening, I went to his house after dark--alone and on foot. I
got<br>
 there safely enough. Returning, I was seized on from behind by
two<br>
 men, dragged down a passage and robbed--not only of the
little<br>
 money I had about me, but also of the knife. It was the
lawyer's<br>
 opinion (as it was mine) that the thieves were among the<br>
 disreputable acquaintances formed by my wife, and that they,
had<br>
 attacked me at her instigation. To confirm this view I received
a<br>
 letter the next day, without date or address, written in
Alicia's<br>
 hand. The first line informed me that the knife was back again
in<br>
 her possession. The second line reminded me of the day when
I<br>
 struck her. The third line warned me that she would wash out
the<br>
 stain of that blow in my blood, and repeated the words, "I shall
do<br>
 it with the knife!"</p>

<p>These things happened a year ago. The law laid hands on the
men<br>
 who had robbed me; but from that time to this, the law has
failed<br>
 completely to find a trace of my wife.</p>

<p>My story is told. When I had paid the creditors and paid the
legal<br>
 expenses, I had barely five pounds left out of the sale of
my<br>
 house; and I had the world to begin over again. Some months
since--<br>
 drifting here and there--I found my way to Underbridge. The<br>
 landlord of the inn had known something of my father's family
in<br>
 times past. He gave me (all he had to give) my food, and
shelter<br>
 in the yard. Except on market days, there is nothing to do.
In<br>
 the coming winter the inn is to be shut up, and I shall have
to<br>
 shift for myself. My old master would help me if I applied to
him--<br>
 but I don't like to apply: he has done more for me already than
I<br>
 deserve. Besides, in another year who knows but my troubles
may<br>
 all be at an end? Next winter will bring me nigh to my next<br>
 birthday, and my next birthday may be the day of my death.
Yes!<br>
 it's true I sat up all last night; and I heard two in the
morning<br>
 strike: and nothing happened. Still, allowing for that, the
time<br>
 to come is a time I don't trust. My wife has got the
knife--my<br>
 wife is looking for me. I am above superstition, mind! I
don't<br>
 say I believe in dreams; I only say, Alicia Warlock is looking
for<br>
 me. It is possible I may be wrong. It is possible I may be
right.<br>
 Who can tell?</p>

<h2>THE THIRD NARRATIVE</h2>

<h3>THE STORY CONTINUED BY PERCY FAIRBANK</h3>

<h3><br>
 XIV</h3>

<p><br>
 We took leave of Francis Raven at the door of Farleigh Hall,
with<br>
 the understanding that he might expect to hear from us
again.</p>

<p>The same night Mrs. Fairbank and I had a discussion in the<br>
 sanctuary of our own room. The topic was "The Hostler's
Story";<br>
 and the question in dispute between us turned on the measure
of<br>
 charitable duty that we owed to the hostler himself.</p>

<p>The view I took of the man's narrative was of the purely
matter-of-<br>
 fact kind. Francis Raven had, in my opinion, brooded over
the<br>
 misty connection between his strange dream and his vile wife,
until<br>
 his mind was in a state of partial delusion on that subject. I
was<br>
 quite willing to help him with a trifle of money, and to
recommend<br>
 him to the kindness of my lawyer, if he was really in any
danger<br>
 and wanted advice. There my idea of my duty toward this
afflicted<br>
 person began and ended.</p>

<p><br>
 Confronted with this sensible view of the matter, Mrs.
Fairbank's<br>
 romantic temperament rushed, as usual, into extremes. "I should
no<br>
 more think of losing sight of Francis Raven when his next
birthday<br>
 comes round," says my wife, "than I should think of laying down
a<br>
 good story with the last chapters unread. I am positively<br>
 determined, Percy, to take him back with us when we return
to<br>
 France, in the capacity of groom. What does one man more or
less<br>
 among the horses matter to people as rich as we are?" In
this<br>
 strain the partner of my joys and sorrows ran on, perfectly<br>
 impenetrable to everything that I could say on the side of
common<br>
 sense. Need I tell my married brethren how it ended? Of course
I<br>
 allowed my wife to irritate me, and spoke to her sharply.</p>

<p>Of course my wife turned her face away indignantly on the
conjugal<br>
 pillow, and burst into tears. Of course upon that, "Mr." made
his<br>
 excuses, and "Mrs." had her own way.</p>

<p>Before the week was out we rode over to Underbridge, and
duly<br>
 offered to Francis Raven a place in our service as
supernumerary<br>
 groom.</p>

<p>At first the poor fellow seemed hardly able to realize his
own<br>
 extraordinary good fortune. Recovering himself, he expressed
his<br>
 gratitude modestly and becomingly. Mrs. Fairbank's ready<br>
 sympathies overflowed, as usual, at her lips. She talked to
him<br>
 about our home in France, as if the worn, gray-headed hostler
had<br>
 been a child. "Such a dear old house, Francis; and such
pretty<br>
 gardens! Stables! Stables ten times as big as your stables
here--<br>
 quite a choice of rooms for you. You must learn the name of
our<br>
 house--Maison Rouge. Our nearest town is Metz. We are within
a<br>
 walk of the beautiful River Moselle. And when we want a change
we<br>
 have only to take the railway to the frontier, and find
ourselves<br>
 in Germany."</p>

<p>Listening, so far, with a very bewildered face, Francis
started and<br>
 changed color when my wife reached the end of her last
sentence.<br>
 "Germany?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes. Does Germany remind you of anything?"</p>

<p>The hostler's eyes looked down sadly on the ground.
"Germany<br>
 reminds me of my wife," he replied.</p>

<p>"Indeed! How?"</p>

<p>"She once told me she had lived in Germany--long before I knew
her-<br>
 -in the time when she was a young girl."</p>

<p>"Was she living with relations or friends?"</p>

<p>"She was living as governess in a foreign family."</p>

<p>"In what part of Germany?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember, ma'am. I doubt if she told me."</p>

<p>"Did she tell you the name of the family?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. It was a foreign name, and it has slipped my
memory<br>
 long since. The head of the family was a wine grower in a
large<br>
 way of business--I remember that."</p>

<p>"Did you hear what sort of wine he grew? There are wine
growers in<br>
 our neighborhood. Was it Moselle wine?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't say, ma'am, I doubt if I ever heard."</p>

<p>There the conversation dropped. We engaged to communicate
with<br>
 Francis Raven before we left England, and took our leave. I
had<br>
 made arrangements to pay our round of visits to English
friends,<br>
 and to return to Maison Rouge in the summer. On the eve of<br>
 departure, certain difficulties in connection with the
management<br>
 of some landed property of mine in Ireland obliged us to alter
our<br>
 plans. Instead of getting back to our house in France in the<br>
 Summer, we only returned a week or two before Christmas.
Francis<br>
 Raven accompanied us, and was duly established, in the
nominal<br>
 capacity of stable keeper, among the servants at Maison
Rouge.</p>

<p>Before long, some of the objections to taking him into our<br>
 employment, which I had foreseen and had vainly mentioned to
my<br>
 wife, forced themselves on our attention in no very agreeable
form.<br>
 Francis Raven failed (as I had feared he would) to get on
smoothly<br>
 with his fellow-servants. They were all French; and not one
of<br>
 them understood English. Francis, on his side, was equally<br>
 ignorant of French. His reserved manners, his melancholy<br>
 temperament, his solitary ways--all told against him. Our
servants<br>
 called him "the English Bear." He grew widely known in the<br>
 neighborhood under his nickname. Quarrels took place, ending
once<br>
 or twice in blows. It became plain, even to Mrs. Fairbank
herself,<br>
 that some wise change must be made. While we were still<br>
 considering what the change was to be, the unfortunate hostler
was<br>
 thrown on our hands for some time to come by an accident in
the<br>
 stables. Still pursued by his proverbial ill-luck, the poor<br>
 wretch's leg was broken by a kick from a horse.</p>

<p>He was attended to by our own surgeon, in his comfortable
bedroom<br>
 at the stables. As the date of his birthday drew near, he
was<br>
 still confined to his bed.</p>

<p>Physically speaking, he was doing very well. Morally speaking,
the<br>
 surgeon was not satisfied. Francis Raven was suffering under
some<br>
 mysterious mental disturbance, which interfered seriously with
his<br>
 rest at night. Hearing this, I thought it my duty to tell
the<br>
 medical attendant what was preying on the patient's mind. As
a<br>
 practical man, he shared my opinion that the hostler was in a
state<br>
 of delusion on the subject of his Wife and his Dream.
"Curable<br>
 delusion, in my opinion," the surgeon added, "if the
experiment<br>
 could be fairly tried."</p>

<p>"How can it be tried?" I asked. Instead of replying, the
surgeon<br>
 put a question to me, on his side.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know," he said, "that this year is Leap
Year?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fairbank reminded me of it yesterday," I answered.<br>
 "Otherwise I might NOT have known it."</p>

<p>"Do you think Francis Raven knows that this year is Leap
Year?"</p>

<p>(I began to see dimly what my friend was driving at.)</p>

<p>"It depends," I answered, "on whether he has got an
English<br>
 almanac. Suppose he has NOT got the almanac--what then?"</p>

<p>"In that case," pursued the surgeon, "Francis Raven is
innocent of<br>
 all suspicion that there is a twenty-ninth day in February
this<br>
 year. As a necessary consequence--what will he do? He will<br>
 anticipate the appearance of the Woman with the Knife, at two
in<br>
 the morning of the twenty-ninth of February, instead of the
first<br>
 of March. Let him suffer all his superstitious terrors on
the<br>
 wrong day. Leave him, on the day that is really his birthday,
to<br>
 pass a perfectly quiet night, and to be as sound asleep as
other<br>
 people at two in the morning. And then, when he wakes
comfortably<br>
 in time for his breakfast, shame him out of his delusion by
telling<br>
 him the truth."</p>

<p>I agreed to try the experiment. Leaving the surgeon to
caution<br>
 Mrs. Fairbank on the subject of Leap Year, I went to the stables
to<br>
 see Mr. Raven.</p>

<h3><br>
 XV</h3>

<p><br>
 The poor fellow was full of forebodings of the fate in store
for<br>
 him on the ominous first of March. He eagerly entreated me
to<br>
 order one of the men servants to sit up with him on the
birthday<br>
 morning. In granting his request, I asked him to tell me on
which<br>
 day of the week his birthday fell. He reckoned the days on
his<br>
 fingers; and proved his innocence of all suspicion that it was
Leap<br>
 Year, by fixing on the twenty-ninth of February, in the full<br>
 persuasion that it was the first of March. Pledged to try
the<br>
 surgeon's experiment, I left his error uncorrected, of course.
In<br>
 so doing, I took my first step blindfold toward the last act in
the<br>
 drama of the Hostler's Dream.</p>

<p><br>
 The next day brought with it a little domestic difficulty,
which<br>
 indirectly and strangely associated itself with the coming
end.</p>

<p>My wife received a letter, inviting us to assist in
celebrating the<br>
 "Silver Wedding" of two worthy German neighbors of ours--Mr.
and<br>
 Mrs. Beldheimer. Mr. Beldheimer was a large wine grower on
the<br>
 banks of the Moselle. His house was situated on the frontier
line<br>
 of France and Germany; and the distance from our house was<br>
 sufficiently considerable to make it necessary for us to
sleep<br>
 under our host's roof. Under these circumstances, if we
accepted<br>
 the invitation, a comparison of dates showed that we should be
away<br>
 from home on the morning of the first of March. Mrs.
Fairbank--<br>
 holding to her absurd resolution to see with her own eyes
what<br>
 might, or might not, happen to Francis Raven on his
birthday--<br>
 flatly declined to leave Maison Rouge. "It's easy to send an<br>
 excuse," she said, in her off-hand manner.</p>

<p>I failed, for my part, to see any easy way out of the
difficulty.<br>
 The celebration of a "Silver Wedding" in Germany is the
celebration<br>
 of twenty-five years of happy married life; and the host's
claim<br>
 upon the consideration of his friends on such an occasion is<br>
 something in the nature of a royal "command." After
considerable<br>
 discussion, finding my wife's obstinacy invincible, and
feeling<br>
 that the absence of both of us from the festival would
certainly<br>
 offend our friends, I left Mrs. Fairbank to make her excuses
for<br>
 herself, and directed her to accept the invitation so far as I
was<br>
 concerned. In so doing, I took my second step, blindfold,
toward<br>
 the last act in the drama of the Hostler's Dream.</p>

<p>A week elapsed; the last days of February were at hand.
Another<br>
 domestic difficulty happened; and, again, this event also proved
to<br>
 be strangely associated with the coming end.</p>

<p>My head groom at the stables was one Joseph Rigobert. He was
an<br>
 ill-conditioned fellow, inordinately vain of his personal<br>
 appearance, and by no means scrupulous in his conduct with
women.<br>
 His one virtue consisted of his fondness for horses, and in
the<br>
 care he took of the animals under his charge. In a word, he
was<br>
 too good a groom to be easily replaced, or he would have quitted
my<br>
 service long since. On the occasion of which I am now writing,
he<br>
 was reported to me by my steward as growing idle and disorderly
in<br>
 his habits. The principal offense alleged against him was, that
he<br>
 had been seen that day in the city of Metz, in the company of
a<br>
 woman (supposed to be an Englishwoman), whom he was entertaining
at<br>
 a tavern, when he ought to have been on his way back to
Maison<br>
 Rouge. The man's defense was that "the lady" (as he called
her)<br>
 was an English stranger, unacquainted with the ways of the
place,<br>
 and that he had only shown her where she could obtain some<br>
 refreshments at her own request. I administered the
necessary<br>
 reprimand, without troubling myself to inquire further into
the<br>
 matter. In failing to do this, I took my third step,
blindfold,<br>
 toward the last act in the drama of the Hostler's Dream.</p>

<p>On the evening of the twenty-eighth, I informed the servants
at the<br>
 stables that one of them must watch through the night by the<br>
 Englishman's bedside. Joseph Rigobert immediately volunteered
for<br>
 the duty--as a means, no doubt, of winning his way back to
my<br>
 favor. I accepted his proposal.</p>

<p>That day the surgeon dined with us. Toward midnight he and I
left<br>
 the smoking room, and repaired to Francis Raven's bedside.<br>
 Rigobert was at his post, with no very agreeable expression on
his<br>
 face. The Frenchman and the Englishman had evidently not got
on<br>
 well together so far. Francis Raven lay helpless on his bed,<br>
 waiting silently for two in the morning and the Dream Woman.</p>

<p>"I have come, Francis, to bid you good night," I said,
cheerfully.<br>
 "To-morrow morning I shall look in at breakfast time, before
I<br>
 leave home on a journey."</p>

<p>"Thank you for all your kindness, sir. You will not see me
alive<br>
 to-morrow morning. She will find me this time. Mark my
words--she<br>
 will find me this time."</p>

<p>"My good fellow! she couldn't find you in England. How in
the<br>
 world is she to find you in France?"</p>

<p>"It's borne in on my mind, sir, that she will find me here. At
two<br>
 in the morning on my birthday I shall see her again, and see
her<br>
 for the last time."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that she will kill you?"</p>

<p>"I mean that, sir, she will kill me--with the knife."</p>

<p>"And with Rigobert in the room to protect you?"</p>

<p>"I am a doomed man. Fifty Rigoberts couldn't protect me."</p>

<p>"And you wanted somebody to sit up with you?"</p>

<p>"Mere weakness, sir. I don't like to be left alone on my<br>
 deathbed."</p>

<p>I looked at the surgeon. If he had encouraged me, I should<br>
 certainly, out of sheer compassion, have confessed to Francis
Raven<br>
 the trick that we were playing him. The surgeon held to his<br>
 experiment; the surgeon's face plainly said--"No."</p>

<p>The next day (the twenty-ninth of February) was the day of
the<br>
 "Silver Wedding." The first thing in the morning, I went to<br>
 Francis Raven's room. Rigobert met me at the door.</p>

<p>"How has he passed the night?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Saying his prayers, and looking for ghosts," Rigobert
answered.<br>
 "A lunatic asylum is the only proper place for him."</p>

<p>I approached the bedside. "Well, Francis, here you are, safe
and<br>
 sound, in spite of what you said to me last night."</p>

<p>His eyes rested on mine with a vacant, wondering look.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," he said.</p>

<p>"Did you see anything of your wife when the clock struck
two?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Did anything happen?"</p>

<p>"Nothing happened, sir."</p>

<p>"Doesn't THIS satisfy you that you were wrong?"</p>

<p>His eyes still kept their vacant, wondering look. He only
repeated<br>
 the words he had spoken already: "I don't understand it."</p>

<p>I made a last attempt to cheer him. "Come, come, Francis! keep
a<br>
 good heart. You will be out of bed in a fortnight."</p>

<p>He shook his head on the pillow. "There's something wrong,"
he<br>
 said. "I don't expect you to believe me, sir. I only say
there's<br>
 something wrong--and time will show it."</p>

<p>I left the room. Half an hour later I started for Mr.
Beldheimer's<br>
 house; leaving the arrangements for the morning of the first
of<br>
 March in the hands of the doctor and my wife.</p>

<h3><br>
 XVI</h3>

<p><br>
 The one thing which principally struck me when I joined the
guests<br>
 at the "Silver Wedding" is also the one thing which it is
necessary<br>
 to mention here. On this joyful occasion a noticeable lady
present<br>
 was out of spirits. That lady was no other than the heroine of
the<br>
 festival, the mistress of the house!</p>

<p>In the course of the evening I spoke to Mr. Beldheimer's
eldest son<br>
 on the subject of his mother. As an old friend of the family,
I<br>
 had a claim on his confidence which the young man willingly<br>
 recognized.</p>

<p><br>
 "We have had a very disagreeable matter to deal with," he
said;<br>
 "and my mother has not recovered the painful impression left on
her<br>
 mind. Many years since, when my sisters were children, we had
an<br>
 English governess in the house. She left us, as we then<br>
 understood, to be married. We heard no more of her until a week
or<br>
 ten days since, when my mother received a letter, in which our
ex-<br>
 governess described herself as being in a condition of great<br>
 poverty and distress. After much hesitation she had
ventured--at<br>
 the suggestion of a lady who had been kind to her--to write to
her<br>
 former employers, and to appeal to their remembrance of old
times.<br>
 You know my mother she is not only the most kind-headed, but
the<br>
 most innocent of women--it is impossible to persuade her of
the<br>
 wickedness that there is in the world. She replied by return
of<br>
 post, inviting the governess to come here and see her, and<br>
 inclosing the money for her traveling expenses. When my
father<br>
 came home, and heard what had been done, he wrote at once to
his<br>
 agent in London to make inquiries, inclosing the address on
the<br>
 governess' letter. Before he could receive the agent's reply
the<br>
 governess arrived. She produced the worst possible impression
on<br>
 his mind. The agent's letter, arriving a few days later,
confirmed<br>
 his suspicions. Since we had lost sight of her, the woman had
led<br>
 a most disreputable life. My father spoke to her privately:
he<br>
 offered--on condition of her leaving the house--a sum of money
to<br>
 take her back to England. If she refused, the alternative would
be<br>
 an appeal to the authorities and a public scandal. She
accepted<br>
 the money, and left the house. On her way back to England
she<br>
 appears to have stopped at Metz. You will understand what sort
of<br>
 woman she is when I tell you that she was seen the other day in
a<br>
 tavern with your handsome groom, Joseph Rigobert."</p>

<p>While my informant was relating these circumstances, my memory
was<br>
 at work. I recalled what Francis Raven had vaguely told us of
his<br>
 wife's experience in former days as governess in a German
family.<br>
 A suspicion of the truth suddenly flashed across my mind.
"What<br>
 was the woman's name?" I asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Beldheimer's son answered: "Alicia Warlock."</p>

<p>I had but one idea when I heard that reply--to get back to my
house<br>
 without a moment's needless delay. It was then ten o'clock
at<br>
 night--the last train to Metz had left long since. I arranged
with<br>
 my young friend--after duly informing him of the
circumstances--<br>
 that I should go by the first train in the morning, instead
of<br>
 staying to breakfast with the other guests who slept in the
house.</p>

<p>At intervals during the night I wondered uneasily how things
were<br>
 going on at Maison Rouge. Again and again the same question<br>
 occurred to me, on my journey home in the early morning--the<br>
 morning of the first of March. As the event proved, but one
person<br>
 in my house knew what really happened at the stables on
Francis<br>
 Raven's birthday. Let Joseph Rigobert take my place as
narrator,<br>
 and tell the story of the end to You--as he told it, in times
past,<br>
 to his lawyer and to Me.</p>

<h2><br>
 FOURTH (AND LAST) NARRATIVE</h2>

<h3>STATEMENT OF JOSEPH RIGOBERT: ADDRESSED TO THE ADVOCATE
WHO<br>
 DEFENDED HIM AT HIS TRIAL</h3>

<p><br>
 RESPECTED SIR,--On the twenty-seventh of February I was sent,
on<br>
 business connected with the stables at Maison Rouge, to the city
of<br>
 Metz. On the public promenade I met a magnificent woman.<br>
 Complexion, blond. Nationality, English. We mutually admired
each<br>
 other; we fell into conversation. (She spoke French
perfectly--<br>
 with the English accent.) I offered refreshment; my proposal
was<br>
 accepted. We had a long and interesting interview--we
discovered<br>
 that we were made for each other. So far, Who is to blame?</p>

<p>Is it my fault that I am a handsome man--universally agreeable
as<br>
 such to the fair sex? Is it a criminal offense to be accessible
to<br>
 the amiable weakness of love? I ask again, Who is to blame?<br>
 Clearly, nature. Not the beautiful lady--not my humble self.</p>

<p><br>
 To resume. The most hard-hearted person living will
understand<br>
 that two beings made for each other could not possibly part
without<br>
 an appointment to meet again.</p>

<p>I made arrangements for the accommodation of the lady in
the<br>
 village near Maison Rouge. She consented to honor me with
her<br>
 company at supper, in my apartment at the stables, on the night
of<br>
 the twenty-ninth. The time fixed on was the time when the
other<br>
 servants were accustomed to retire--eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>Among the grooms attached to the stables was an Englishman,
laid up<br>
 with a broken leg. His name was Francis. His manners were<br>
 repulsive; he was ignorant of the French language. In the
kitchen<br>
 he went by the nickname of the "English Bear." Strange to say,
he<br>
 was a great favorite with my master and my mistress. They
even<br>
 humored certain superstitious terrors to which this
repulsive<br>
 person was subject--terrors into the nature of which I, as
an<br>
 advanced freethinker, never thought it worth my while to
inquire.</p>

<p>On the evening of the twenty-eighth the Englishman, being a
prey to<br>
 the terrors which I have mentioned, requested that one of
his<br>
 fellow-servants might sit up with him for that night only.
The<br>
 wish that he expressed was backed by Mr. Fairbank's
authority.<br>
 Having already incurred my master's displeasure--in what way,
a<br>
 proper sense of my own dignity forbids me to relate--I
volunteered<br>
 to watch by the bedside of the English Bear. My object was
to<br>
 satisfy Mr. Fairbank that I bore no malice, on my side, after
what<br>
 had occurred between us. The wretched Englishman passed a night
of<br>
 delirium. Not understanding his barbarous language, I could
only<br>
 gather from his gesture that he was in deadly fear of some
fancied<br>
 apparition at his bedside. From time to time, when this
madman<br>
 disturbed my slumbers, I quieted him by swearing at him. This
is<br>
 the shortest and best way of dealing with persons in his
condition.</p>

<p>On the morning of the twenty-ninth, Mr. Fairbank left us on
a<br>
 journey. Later in the day, to my unspeakable disgust, I found
that<br>
 I had not done with the Englishman yet. In Mr. Fairbank's
absence,<br>
 Mrs. Fairbank took an incomprehensible interest in the question
of<br>
 my delirious fellow-servant's repose at night. Again, one or
the<br>
 other of us was to watch at his bedside, and report it, if
anything<br>
 happened. Expecting my fair friend to supper, it was necessary
to<br>
 make sure that the other servants at the stables would be safe
in<br>
 their beds that night. Accordingly, I volunteered once more to
be<br>
 the man who kept watch. Mrs. Fairbank complimented me on my<br>
 humanity. I possess great command over my feelings. I
accepted<br>
 the compliment without a blush.</p>

<p>Twice, after nightfall, my mistress and the doctor (the
last<br>
 staying in the house in Mr. Fairbank's absence) came to make<br>
 inquiries. Once BEFORE the arrival of my fair friend--and
once<br>
 AFTER. On the second occasion (my apartment being next door to
the<br>
 Englishman's) I was obliged to hide my charming guest in the<br>
 harness room. She consented, with angelic resignation, to
immolate<br>
 her dignity to the servile necessities of my position. A
more<br>
 amiable woman (so far) I never met with!</p>

<p>After the second visit I was left free. It was then close
on<br>
 midnight. Up to that time there was nothing in the behavior of
the<br>
 mad Englishman to reward Mrs. Fairbank and the doctor for<br>
 presenting themselves at his bedside. He lay half awake,
half<br>
 asleep, with an odd wondering kind of look in his face. My<br>
 mistress at parting warned me to be particularly watchful of
him<br>
 toward two in the morning. The doctor (in case anything
happened)<br>
 left me a large hand bell to ring, which could easily be heard
at<br>
 the house.</p>

<p>Restored to the society of my fair friend, I spread the
supper<br>
 table. A pate, a sausage, and a few bottles of generous
Moselle<br>
 wine, composed our simple meal. When persons adore each other,
the<br>
 intoxicating illusion of Love transforms the simplest meal into
a<br>
 banquet. With immeasurable capacities for enjoyment, we sat
down<br>
 to table. At the very moment when I placed my fascinating<br>
 companion in a chair, the infamous Englishman in the next room
took<br>
 that occasion, of all others, to become restless and noisy
once<br>
 more. He struck with his stick on the floor; he cried out, in
a<br>
 delirious access of terror, "Rigobert! Rigobert!"</p>

<p>The sound of that lamentable voice, suddenly assailing our
ears,<br>
 terrified my fair friend. She lost all her charming color in
an<br>
 instant. "Good heavens!" she exclaimed. "Who is that in the
next<br>
 room?"</p>

<p>"A mad Englishman."</p>

<p>"An Englishman?"</p>

<p>"Compose yourself, my angel. I will quiet him." The
lamentable<br>
 voice called out on me again, "Rigobert! Rigobert!"</p>

<p>My fair friend caught me by the arm. "Who is he?" she
cried.<br>
 "What is his name?"</p>

<p>Something in her face struck me as she put that question. A
spasm<br>
 of jealousy shook me to the soul. "You know him?" I said.</p>

<p>"His name!" she vehemently repeated; "his name!"</p>

<p>"Francis," I answered.</p>

<p>"Francis--WHAT?"</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. I could neither remember nor
pronounce<br>
 the barbarous English surname. I could only tell her it began
with<br>
 an "R."</p>

<p>She dropped back into the chair. Was she going to faint? No:
she<br>
 recovered, and more than recovered, her lost color. Her eyes<br>
 flashed superbly. What did it mean? Profoundly as I
understand<br>
 women in general, I was puzzled by THIS woman!</p>

<p>"You know him?" I repeated.</p>

<p>She laughed at me. "What nonsense! How should I know him? Go
and<br>
 quiet the wretch."</p>

<p>My looking-glass was near. One glance at it satisfied me that
no<br>
 woman in her senses could prefer the Englishman to Me. I
recovered<br>
 my self-respect. I hastened to the Englishman's bedside.</p>

<p>The moment I appeared he pointed eagerly toward my room.
He<br>
 overwhelmed me with a torrent of words in his own language. I
made<br>
 out, from his gestures and his looks, that he had, in some<br>
 incomprehensible manner, discovered the presence of my guest;
and,<br>
 stranger still, that he was scared by the idea of a person in
my<br>
 room. I endeavored to compose him on the system which I have<br>
 already mentioned--that is to say, I swore at him in MY
language.<br>
 The result not proving satisfactory, I own I shook my fist in
his<br>
 face, and left the bedchamber.</p>

<p>Returning to my fair friend, I found her walking backward
and<br>
 forward in a state of excitement wonderful to behold. She had
not<br>
 waited for me to fill her glass--she had begun the generous
Moselle<br>
 in my absence. I prevailed on her with difficulty to place
herself<br>
 at the table. Nothing would induce her to eat. "My appetite
is<br>
 gone," she said. "Give me wine."</p>

<p>The generous Moselle deserves its name--delicate on the
palate,<br>
 with prodigious "body." The strength of this fine wine produced
no<br>
 stupefying effect on my remarkable guest. It appeared to<br>
 strengthen and exhilarate her--nothing more. She always spoke
in<br>
 the same low tone, and always, turn the conversation as I
might,<br>
 brought it back with the same dexterity to the subject of
the<br>
 Englishman in the next room. In any other woman this
persistency<br>
 would have offended me. My lovely guest was irresistible; I<br>
 answered her questions with the docility of a child. She
possessed<br>
 all the amusing eccentricity of her nation. When I told her of
the<br>
 accident which confined the Englishman to his bed, she sprang
to<br>
 her feet. An extraordinary smile irradiated her countenance.
She<br>
 said, "Show me the horse who broke the Englishman's leg! I
must<br>
 see that horse!" I took her to the stables. She kissed the
horse-<br>
 -on my word of honor, she kissed the horse! That struck me.
I<br>
 said. "You DO know the man; and he has wronged you in some
way."<br>
 No! she would not admit it, even then. "I kiss all beautiful<br>
 animals," she said. "Haven't I kissed YOU?" With that
charming<br>
 explanation of her conduct, she ran back up the stairs. I
only<br>
 remained behind to lock the stable door again. When I
rejoined<br>
 her, I made a startling discovery. I caught her coming out of
the<br>
 Englishman's room.</p>

<p>"I was just going downstairs again to call you," she said.
"The<br>
 man in there is getting noisy once more."</p>

<p>The mad Englishman's voice assailed our ears once again.<br>
 "Rigobert! Rigobert!"</p>

<p>He was a frightful object to look at when I saw him this time.
His<br>
 eyes were staring wildly; the perspiration was pouring over
his<br>
 face. In a panic of terror he clasped his hands; he pointed up
to<br>
 heaven. By every sign and gesture that a man can make, he<br>
 entreated me not to leave him again. I really could not help<br>
 smiling. The idea of my staying with HIM, and leaving my
fair<br>
 friend by herself in the next room!</p>

<p>I turned to the door. When the mad wretch saw me leaving him
he<br>
 burst out into a screech of despair--so shrill that I feared
it<br>
 might awaken the sleeping servants.</p>

<p>My presence of mind in emergencies is proverbial among those
who<br>
 know me. I tore open the cupboard in which he kept his
linen--<br>
 seized a handful of his handkerchief's--gagged him with one
of<br>
 them, and secured his hands with the others. There was now
no<br>
 danger of his alarming the servants. After tying the last knot,
I<br>
 looked up.</p>

<p>The door between the Englishman's room and mine was open. My
fair<br>
 friend was standing on the threshold--watching HIM as he lay<br>
 helpless on the bed; watching ME as I tied the last knot.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" I asked. "Why did you open the
door?"</p>

<p>She stepped up to me, and whispered her answer in my ear, with
her<br>
 eyes all the time upon the man on the bed:</p>

<p>"I heard him scream."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I thought you had killed him."</p>

<p>I drew back from her in horror. The suspicion of me which
her<br>
 words implied was sufficiently detestable in itself. But her<br>
 manner when she uttered the words was more revolting still. It
so<br>
 powerfully affected me that I started back from that
beautiful<br>
 creature as I might have recoiled from a reptile crawling over
my<br>
 flesh.</p>

<p>Before I had recovered myself sufficiently to reply, my nerves
were<br>
 assailed by another shock. I suddenly heard my mistress's
voice<br>
 calling to me from the stable yard.</p>

<p>There was no time to think--there was only time to act. The
one<br>
 thing needed was to keep Mrs. Fairbank from ascending the
stairs,<br>
 and discovering--not my lady guest only--but the Englishman
also,<br>
 gagged and bound on his bed. I instantly hurried to the yard.
As<br>
 I ran down the stairs I heard the stable clock strike the
quarter<br>
 to two in the morning.</p>

<p>My mistress was eager and agitated. The doctor (in attendance
on<br>
 her) was smiling to himself, like a man amused at his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Is Francis awake or asleep?" Mrs. Fairbank inquired.</p>

<p>"He has been a little restless, madam. But he is now quiet
again.<br>
 If he is not disturbed" (I added those words to prevent her
from<br>
 ascending the stairs), "he will soon fall off into a quiet
sleep."</p>

<p>"Has nothing happened since I was here last?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, madam."</p>

<p>The doctor lifted his eyebrows with a comical look of
distress.<br>
 "Alas, alas, Mrs. Fairbank!" he said. "Nothing has happened!
The<br>
 days of romance are over!"</p>

<p>"It is not two o'clock yet," my mistress answered, a
little<br>
 irritably.</p>

<p>The smell of the stables was strong on the morning air. She
put<br>
 her handkerchief to her nose and led the way out of the yard by
the<br>
 north entrance--the entrance communicating with the gardens and
the<br>
 house. I was ordered to follow her, along with the doctor.
Once<br>
 out of the smell of the stables she began to question me
again.<br>
 She was unwilling to believe that nothing had occurred in
her<br>
 absence. I invented the best answers I could think of on the
spur<br>
 of the moment; and the doctor stood by laughing. So the
minutes<br>
 passed till the clock struck two. Upon that, Mrs. Fairbank<br>
 announced her intention of personally visiting the Englishman
in<br>
 his room. To my great relief, the doctor interfered to stop
her<br>
 from doing this.</p>

<p>"You have heard that Francis is just falling asleep," he said.
"If<br>
 you enter his room you may disturb him. It is essential to
the<br>
 success of my experiment that he should have a good night's
rest,<br>
 and that he should own it himself, before I tell him the truth.
I<br>
 must request, madam, that you will not disturb the man.
Rigobert<br>
 will ring the alarm bell if anything happens."</p>

<p>My mistress was unwilling to yield. For the next five minutes,
at<br>
 least, there was a warm discussion between the two. In the
end<br>
 Mrs. Fairbank was obliged to give way--for the time. "In half
an<br>
 hour," she said, "Francis will either be sound asleep, or
awake<br>
 again. In half an hour I shall come back." She took the
doctor's<br>
 arm. They returned together to the house.</p>

<p>Left by myself, with half an hour before me, I resolved to
take the<br>
 Englishwoman back to the village--then, returning to the
stables,<br>
 to remove the gag and the bindings from Francis, and to let
him<br>
 screech to his heart's content. What would his alarming the
whole<br>
 establishment matter to ME after I had got rid of the
compromising<br>
 presence of my guest?</p>

<p>Returning to the yard I heard a sound like the creaking of an
open<br>
 door on its hinges. The gate of the north entrance I had
just<br>
 closed with my own hand. I went round to the west entrance, at
the<br>
 back of the stables. It opened on a field crossed by two
footpaths<br>
 in Mr. Fairbank's grounds. The nearest footpath led to the<br>
 village. The other led to the highroad and the river.</p>

<p>Arriving at the west entrance I found the door open--swinging
to<br>
 and fro slowly in the fresh morning breeze. I had myself
locked<br>
 and bolted that door after admitting my fair friend at
eleven<br>
 o'clock. A vague dread of something wrong stole its way into
my<br>
 mind. I hurried back to the stables.</p>

<p>I looked into my own room. It was empty. I went to the
harness<br>
 room. Not a sign of the woman was there. I returned to my
room,<br>
 and approached the door of the Englishman's bedchamber. Was
it<br>
 possible that she had remained there during my absence? An<br>
 unaccountable reluctance to open the door made me hesitate, with
my<br>
 hand on the lock. I listened. There was not a sound inside.
I<br>
 called softly. There was no answer. I drew back a step,
still<br>
 hesitating. I noticed something dark moving slowly in the
crevice<br>
 between the bottom of the door and the boarded floor. Snatching
up<br>
 the candle from the table, I held it low, and looked. The
dark,<br>
 slowly moving object was a stream of blood!</p>

<p><br>
 That horrid sight roused me. I opened the door. The
Englishman<br>
 lay on his bed--alone in the room. He was stabbed in two
places--<br>
 in the throat and in the heart. The weapon was left in the
second<br>
 wound. It was a knife of English manufacture, with a handle
of<br>
 buckhorn as good as new.</p>

<p>I instantly gave the alarm. Witnesses can speak to what
followed.<br>
 It is monstrous to suppose that I am guilty of the murder. I
admit<br>
 that I am capable of committing follies: but I shrink from the
bare<br>
 idea of a crime. Besides, I had no motive for killing the
man.<br>
 The woman murdered him in my absence. The woman escaped by
the<br>
 west entrance while I was talking to my mistress. I have no
more<br>
 to say. I swear to you what I have here written is a true<br>
 statement of all that happened on the morning of the first
of<br>
 March.</p>

<p>Accept, sir, the assurance of my sentiments of profound
gratitude<br>
 and respect.</p>

<p>JOSEPH RIGOBERT.</p>

<h2><br>
 LAST LINES--ADDED BY PERCY FAIRBANK</h2>

<p><br>
 Tried for the murder of Francis Raven, Joseph Rigobert was
found<br>
 Not Guilty; the papers of the assassinated man presented
ample<br>
 evidence of the deadly animosity felt toward him by his
wife.</p>

<p>The investigations pursued on the morning when the crime
was<br>
 committed showed that the murderess, after leaving the stable,
had<br>
 taken the footpath which led to the river. The river was
dragged--<br>
 without result. It remains doubtful to this day whether she
died<br>
 by drowning or not. The one thing certain is--that Alicia
Warlock<br>
 was never seen again.</p>

<p><br>
 So--beginning in mystery, ending in mystery--the Dream Woman
passes<br>
 from your view. Ghost; demon; or living human creature--say
for<br>
 yourselves which she is. Or, knowing what unfathomed wonders
are<br>
 around you, what unfathomed wonders are IN you, let the wise
words<br>
 of the greatest of all poets be explanation enough:</p>

 As dreams are made of, and our little life<br>
 Is rounded with a sleep."</p>

<h2>The Lost Duchess</h2>

<h3><br>
 I</h3>

<p><br>
 "Has the duchess returned?"</p>

<p>"No, your grace."</p>

<p>Knowles came farther into the room. He had a letter on a
salver.<br>
 When the duke had taken it, Knowles still lingered. The duke<br>
 glanced at him.</p>

<p><br>
 "Is an answer required?"</p>

<p>"No, your grace." Still Knowles lingered. "Something a
little<br>
 singular has happened. The carriage has returned without the<br>
 duchess, and the men say that they thought her grace was in
it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I hardly understand myself, your grace. Perhaps you would
like to<br>
 see Barnes."</p>

<p>Barnes was the coachman.</p>

<p>"Send him up." When Knowles had gone, and he was alone, his
grace<br>
 showed signs of being slightly annoyed. He looked at his
watch.<br>
 "I told her she'd better be in by four. She says that she's
not<br>
 feeling well, and yet one would think that she was not aware of
the<br>
 fatigue entailed in having the prince come to dinner, and a mob
of<br>
 people to follow. I particularly wished her to lie down for
a<br>
 couple of hours."</p>

<p>Knowles ushered in not only Barnes, the coachman, but Moysey,
the<br>
 footman, too. Both these persons seemed to be ill at ease.
The<br>
 duke glanced at them sharply. In his voice there was a
suggestion<br>
 of impatience.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Barnes explained as best he could.</p>

<p>"If you please, your grace, we waited for the duchess outside
Cane<br>
 and Wilson's, the drapers. The duchess came out, got into
the<br>
 carriage, and Moysey shut the door, and her grace said, 'Home!'
and<br>
 yet when we got home she wasn't there."</p>

<p>"She wasn't where?"</p>

<p>"Her grace wasn't in the carriage, your grace."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Her grace did get into the carriage; you shut the door,
didn't<br>
 you?"</p>

<p>Barnes turned to Moysey. Moysey brought his hand up to his
brow in<br>
 a sort of military salute--he had been a soldier in the regiment
in<br>
 which, once upon a time, the duke had been a subaltern.</p>

<p>"She did. The duchess came out of the shop. She seemed rather
in<br>
 a hurry, I thought. She got into the carriage, and she said,<br>
 'Home, Moysey!' I shut the door, and Barnes drove straight
home.<br>
 We never stopped anywhere, and we never noticed nothing happen
on<br>
 the way; and yet when we got home the carriage was empty."</p>

<p>The duke started.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that the duchess got out of the
carriage<br>
 while you were driving full pelt through the streets without
saying<br>
 anything to you, and without you noticing it?"</p>

<p>"The carriage was empty when we got home, your grace."</p>

<p>"Was either of the doors open?"</p>

<p>"No, your grace."</p>

<p>"You fellows have been up to some infernal mischief. You have
made<br>
 a mess of it. You never picked up the duchess, and you're
trying<br>
 to palm this tale off on me to save yourselves."</p>

<p>Barnes was moved to adjuration:</p>

<p>"I'll take my Bible oath, your grace, that the duchess got
into the<br>
 carriage outside Cane and Wilson's."</p>

<p>Moysey seconded his colleague.</p>

<p>"I will swear to that, your grace. She got into that carriage,
and<br>
 I shut the door, and she said, 'Home, Moysey!'"</p>

<p>The duke looked as if he did not know what to make of the
story and<br>
 its tellers.</p>

<p>"What carriage did you have?"</p>

<p>"Her grace's brougham, your grace."</p>

<p>Knowles interposed:</p>

<p>"The brougham was ordered because I understood that the
duchess was<br>
 not feeling very well, and there's rather a high wind, your
grace."</p>

<p>The duke snapped at him:</p>

<p>"What has that to do with it? Are you suggesting that the
duchess<br>
 was more likely to jump out of a brougham while it was
dashing<br>
 through the streets than out of any other kind of vehicle?"</p>

<p>The duke's glance fell on the letter which Knowles had brought
him<br>
 when he first had entered. He had placed it on his writing
table.<br>
 Now he took it up. It was, addressed:</p>

<p><br>
 "To His Grace the Duke of Datchet.</p>

<p>Private!</p>

<p>VERY PRESSING! ! !"</p>

<p><br>
 The name was written in a fine, clear, almost feminine hand.
The<br>
 words in the left-hand corner of the envelope were written in
a<br>
 different hand. They were large and bold; almost as though
they<br>
 had been painted with the end of the penholder instead of
being<br>
 written with the pen. The envelope itself was of an unusual
size,<br>
 and bulged out as though it contained something else besides
a<br>
 letter.</p>

<p><br>
 The duke tore the envelope open. As he did so something fell
out<br>
 of it on to the writing table. It looked as though it was a
lock<br>
 of a woman's hair. As he glanced at it the duke seemed to be
a<br>
 trifle startled. The duke read the letter:</p>

<p><br>
 "Your grace will be so good as to bring five hundred pounds in
gold<br>
 to the Piccadilly end of the Burlington Arcade within an hour
of<br>
 the receipt of this. The Duchess of Datchet has been kidnaped.
An<br>
 imitation duchess got into the carriage, which was waiting
outside<br>
 Cane and Wilson's, and she alighted on the road. Unless your
grace<br>
 does as you are requested, the Duchess of Datchet's
left-hand<br>
 little finger will be at once cut off, and sent home in time
to<br>
 receive the prince to dinner. Other portions of her grace
will<br>
 follow. A lock of her grace's hair is inclosed with this as
an<br>
 earnest of our good intentions.</p>

<p>"BEFORE 5:30 P.M. your grace is requested to be at the
Piccadilly<br>
 end of the Burlington Arcade with five hundred pounds in gold.
You<br>
 will there be accosted by an individual in a white top hat,
and<br>
 with a gardenia in his buttonhole. You will be entirely at
liberty<br>
 to give him into custody, or to have him followed by the police,
in<br>
 which case the duchess's left arm, cut off at the shoulder, will
be<br>
 sent home for dinner--not to mention other extremely
possible<br>
 contingencies. But you are ADVISED to give the individual in<br>
 question the five hundred pounds in gold, because in that case
the<br>
 duchess herself will he home in time to receive the prince
to<br>
 dinner, and with one of the best stories with which to
entertain<br>
 your distinguished guests they ever heard.</p>

<p>"Remember! NOT LATER THAN 5:30, unless you wish to receive
her<br>
 grace's little finger."</p>

<p><br>
 The duke stared at this amazing epistle when he had read it
as<br>
 though he found it difficult to believe the evidence of his
eyes.<br>
 He was not a demonstrative person, as a rule, but this
little<br>
 communication astonished even him. He read it again. Then
his<br>
 hands dropped to his sides, and he swore.</p>

<p>He took up the lock of hair which had fallen out of the
envelope.<br>
 Was it possible that it could be his wife's, the duchess? Was
it<br>
 possible that a Duchess of Datchet could be kidnaped, in
broad<br>
 daylight, in the heart of London, and be sent home, as it were,
in<br>
 pieces? Had sacrilegious hands already been playing pranks
with<br>
 that great lady's hair? Certainly, THAT hair was so like HER
hair<br>
 that the mere resemblance made his grace's blood run cold.
He<br>
 turned on Messrs. Barnes and Moysey as though he would have
liked<br>
 to rend them.</p>

<p>"You scoundrels!"</p>

<p>He moved forward as though the intention had entered his
ducal<br>
 heart to knock his servants down. But, if that were so, he did
not<br>
 act quite up to his intention. Instead, he stretched out his
arm,<br>
 pointing at them as if he were an accusing spirit:</p>

<p>"Will you swear that it was the duchess who got into the
carriage<br>
 outside Cane and Wilson's?"</p>

<p>Barnes began to stammer:</p>

<p>"I'll swear, your grace, that I--I thought--"</p>

<p>The duke stormed an interruption:</p>

<p>"I don't ask what you thought. I ask you, will you swear it
was?"</p>

<p>The duke's anger was more than Barnes could face. He was
silent.<br>
 Moysey showed a larger courage.</p>

<p>"I could have sworn that it was at the time, your grace. But
now<br>
 it seems to me that it's a rummy go."</p>

<p>"A rummy go!" The peculiarity of the phrase did not seem to
strike<br>
 the duke just then--at least, he echoed it as if it didn't.
"You<br>
 call it a rummy go! Do you know that I am told in this letter
that<br>
 the woman who entered the carriage was not the duchess? What
you<br>
 were thinking about, or what case you will be able to make out
for<br>
 yourselves, you know better than I; but I can tell you
this--that<br>
 in an hour you will leave my service, and you may esteem
yourselves<br>
 fortunate if, to-night, you are not both of you sleeping in
jail."</p>

<p>One might almost have suspected that the words were spoken
in<br>
 irony. But before they could answer, another servant entered,
who<br>
 also brought a letter for the duke. When his grace's glance
fell<br>
 on it he uttered an exclamation. The writing on the envelope
was<br>
 the same writing that had been on the envelope which had
contained<br>
 the very singular communication--like it in all respects, down
to<br>
 the broomstick-end thickness of the "Private!" and "Very<br>
 pressing!!!" in the corner.</p>

<p>"Who brought this?" stormed the duke.</p>

<p>The servant appeared to be a little startled by the violence
of his<br>
 grace's manner.</p>

<p>"A lady--or, at least, your grace, she seemed to be a
lady."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"She came in a hansom, your grace. She gave me that letter,
and<br>
 said, 'Give that to the Duke of Datchet at once--without a
moment's<br>
 delay!' Then she got into the hansom again, and drove away."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you stop her?"</p>

<p>"Your grace!"</p>

<p>The man seemed surprised, as though the idea of stopping
chance<br>
 visitors to the ducal mansion vi et armis had not, until
that<br>
 moment, entered into his philosophy. The duke continued to
regard<br>
 the man as if he could say a good deal, if he chose. Then he<br>
 pointed to the door. His lips said nothing, but his gesture
much.<br>
 The servant vanished.</p>

<p>"Another hoax!" the duke said grimly, as he tore the envelope
open.</p>

<p>This time the envelope contained a sheet of paper, and in the
sheet<br>
 of paper another envelope. The duke unfolded the sheet of
paper.<br>
 On it some words were written. These:</p>

<p>"The duchess appears so particularly anxious to drop you a
line,<br>
 that one really hasn't the heart to refuse her.</p>

<p>"Her grace's communication--written amidst blinding
tears!--you<br>
 will find inclosed with this."</p>

<p>"Knowles," said the duke, in a voice which actually
trembled,<br>
 "Knowles, hoax or no hoax, I will be even with the gentleman
who<br>
 wrote that."</p>

<p>Handing the sheet of paper to Mr. Knowles, his grace turned
his<br>
 attention to the envelope which had been inclosed. It was a
small,<br>
 square envelope, of the finest quality, and it reeked with
perfume.<br>
 The duke's countenance assumed an added frown--he had no
fondness<br>
 for envelopes which were scented. In the center of the
envelope<br>
 were the words, "To the Duke of Datchet," written in the big,
bold,<br>
 sprawling hand which he knew so well.</p>

<p>"Mabel's writing," he said, half to himself, as, with
shaking<br>
 fingers, he tore the envelope open.</p>

<p>The sheet of paper which he took out was almost as stiff
as<br>
 cardboard. It, too, emitted what his grace deemed the
nauseous<br>
 odors of the perfumer's shop. On it was written this letter:</p>

<p><br>
 "MY DEAR HEREWARD--For Heaven's sake do what these people
require!<br>
 I don't know what has happened or where I am, but I am
nearly<br>
 distracted! They have already cut off some of my hair, and
they<br>
 tell me that, if you don't let them have five hundred pounds
in<br>
 gold by half-past five, they will cut off my little finger too.
I<br>
 would sooner die than lose my little finger--and--I don't know
what<br>
 else besides.</p>

<p>"By the token which I send you, and which has never, until
now,<br>
 been off my breast, I conjure you to help me.</p>

<p>"Hereward--HELP ME!"</p>

<p><br>
 When he read that letter the duke turned white--very white,
as<br>
 white as the paper on which it was written. He passed the
epistle<br>
 on to Knowles.</p>

<p>"I suppose that also is a hoax?"</p>

<p>Mr. Knowles was silent. He still yielded to his
constitutional<br>
 disrelish to commit himself. At last he asked:</p>

<p>"What is it that your grace proposes to do?"</p>

<p>The duke spoke with a bitterness which almost suggested a
personal<br>
 animosity toward the inoffensive Mr. Knowles.</p>

<p>"I propose, with your permission, to release the duchess from
the<br>
 custody of my estimable correspondent. I propose--always with
your<br>
 permission--to comply with his modest request, and to take him
his<br>
 five hundred pounds in gold." He paused, then continued in a
tone<br>
 which, coming from him, meant volumes: "Afterwards, I propose
to<br>
 cry quits with the concocter of this pretty little hoax, even if
it<br>
 costs me every penny I possess. He shall pay more for that
five<br>
 hundred pounds than he supposes."</p>

<h3><br>
 II</h3>

<p><br>
 The Duke of Datchet, coming out of the bank, lingered for a
moment<br>
 on the steps. In one hand he carried a canvas bag which
seemed<br>
 well weighted. On his countenance there was an expression which
to<br>
 a casual observer might have suggested that his grace was
not<br>
 completely at his ease. That casual observer happened to
come<br>
 strolling by. It took the form of Ivor Dacre.</p>

<p><br>
 Mr. Dacre looked the Duke of Datchet up and down in that
languid<br>
 way he has. He perceived the canvas bag. Then he remarked,<br>
 possibly intending to be facetious:</p>

<p>"Been robbing the bank? Shall I call a cart?"</p>

<p>Nobody minds what Ivor Dacre says. Besides, he is the duke's
own<br>
 cousin. Perhaps a little removed; still, there it is. So the
duke<br>
 smiled a sickly smile, as if Mr. Dacre's delicate wit had given
him<br>
 a passing touch of indigestion.</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre noticed that the duke looked sallow, so he gave
his<br>
 pretty sense of humor another airing.</p>

<p>"Kitchen boiler burst? When I saw the duchess just now I
wondered<br>
 if it had."</p>

<p>His grace distinctly started. He almost dropped the canvas
bag.</p>

<p>"You saw the duchess just now, Ivor! When?"</p>

<p>The duke was evidently moved. Mr. Dacre was stirred to
languid<br>
 curiosity. "I can't say I clocked it. Perhaps half an hour
ago;<br>
 perhaps a little more."</p>

<p>"Half an hour ago! Are you sure? Where did you see her?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre wondered. The Duchess of Datchet could scarcely
have<br>
 been eloping in broad daylight. Moreover, she had not yet
been<br>
 married a year. Everyone knew that she and the duke were still
as<br>
 fond of each other as if they were not man and wife. So,
although<br>
 the duke, for some cause or other, was evidently in an odd state
of<br>
 agitation, Mr. Dacre saw no reason why he should not make a
clean<br>
 breast of all he knew.</p>

<p>"She was going like blazes in a hansom cab."</p>

<p>"In a hansom cab? Where?"</p>

<p>"Down Waterloo Place."</p>

<p>"Was she alone?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre reflected. He glanced at the duke out of the corners
of<br>
 his eyes. His languid utterance became a positive drawl.</p>

<p>"I rather fancy that she wasn't."</p>

<p>"Who was with her?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, if you were to offer me the bank I couldn't
tell<br>
 you."</p>

<p>"Was it a man?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre's drawl became still more pronounced.</p>

<p>"I rather fancy that it was."</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre expected something. The duke was so excited. But he
by<br>
 no means expected what actually came.</p>

<p>"Ivor, she's been kidnaped!"</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre did what he had never been known to do before within
the<br>
 memory of man--he dropped his eyeglass.</p>

<p>"Datchet!"</p>

<p>"She has! Some scoundrel has decoyed her away, and trapped
her.<br>
 He's already sent me a lock of her hair, and he tells me that if
I<br>
 don't let him have five hundred pounds in gold by half-past
five<br>
 he'll let me have her little finger."</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre did not know what to make of his grace at all. He
was a<br>
 sober man--it COULDN'T be that! Mr. Dacre felt really
concerned.</p>

<p>"I'll call a cab, old man, and you'd better let me see you
home."</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre half raised his stick to hail a passing hansom. The
duke<br>
 caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>"You ass! What do you mean? I am telling you the simple
truth.<br>
 My wife's been kidnaped."</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre's countenance was a thing to be seen--and
remembered.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hadn't heard that there was much of that sort of thing
about<br>
 just now. They talk of poodles being kidnaped, but as for<br>
 duchesses-- You'd really better let me call that cab."</p>

<p>"Ivor, do you want me to kick you? Don't you see that to me
it's a<br>
 question of life and death? I've been in there to get the
money."<br>
 His grace motioned toward the bank. "I'm going to take it to
the<br>
 scoundrel who has my darling at his mercy. Let me but have
her<br>
 hand in mine again, and he shall continue to pay for every<br>
 sovereign with tears of blood until he dies."</p>

<p>"Look here, Datchet, I don't know if you're having a joke with
me,<br>
 or if you're not well--"</p>

<p>The duke stepped impatiently into the roadway.</p>

<p>"Ivor, you're a fool! Can't you tell jest from earnest,
health<br>
 from disease? I'm off! Are you coming with me? It would be
as<br>
 well that I should have a witness."</p>

<p>"Where are you off to?"</p>

<p>"To the other end of the Arcade."</p>

<p>"Who is the gentleman you expect to have the pleasure of
meeting<br>
 there?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" The duke took a letter from his
pocket--it<br>
 was the letter which had just arrived. "The fellow is to wear
a<br>
 white top hat, and a gardenia in his buttonhole."</p>

<p>"What is it you have there?"</p>

<p>"It's the letter which brought the news--look for yourself and
see;<br>
 but, for God's sake, make haste!" His grace glanced at his
watch.<br>
 "It's already twenty after five."</p>

<p>"And do you mean to say that on the strength of a letter such
as<br>
 this you are going to hand over five hundred pounds to--"</p>

<p>The duke cut Mr. Dacre short.</p>

<p>"What are five hundred pounds to me? Besides, you don't know
all.<br>
 There is another letter. And I have heard from Mabel. But I
will<br>
 tell you all about it later. If you are coming, come!"</p>

<p>Folding up the letter, Mr. Dacre returned it to the duke.</p>

<p>"As you say, what are five hundred pounds to you? It's as
well<br>
 they are not as much to you as they are to me, or I'm
afraid--"</p>

<p>"Hang it, Ivor, do prose afterwards!"</p>

<p>The duke hurried across the road. Mr. Dacre hastened after
him.<br>
 As they entered the Arcade they passed a constable. Mr.
Dacre<br>
 touched his companion's arm.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we'd better ask our friend in blue to walk
behind<br>
 us? His neighborhood might be handy."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" The duke stopped short. "Ivor, this is my affair,
not<br>
 yours. If you are not content to play the part of silent
witness,<br>
 be so good as to leave me."</p>

<p>"My dear Datchet, I'm entirely at your service. I can be
every<br>
 whit as insane as you, I do assure you."</p>

<p>Side by side they moved rapidly down the Burlington Arcade.
The<br>
 duke was obviously in a state of the extremest nervous
tension.<br>
 Mr. Dacre was equally obviously in a state of the most
supreme<br>
 enjoyment. People stared as they rushed past. The duke saw<br>
 nothing. Mr. Dacre saw everything, and smiled.</p>

<p>When they reached the Piccadilly end of the Arcade the duke
pulled<br>
 up. He looked about him. Mr. Dacre also looked about him.</p>

<p>"I see nothing of your white-hatted and
gardenia-buttonholed<br>
 friend," said Ivor.</p>

<p>The duke referred to his watch.</p>

<p>"It's not yet half-past five. I'm up to time."</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre held his stick in front of him and leaned on it.
He<br>
 indulged himself with a beatific smile.</p>

<p>"It strikes me, my dear Datchet, that you've been the victim
of one<br>
 of the finest things in hoaxes--"</p>

<p>"I hope I haven't kept you waiting."</p>

<p>The voice which interrupted Mr. Dacre came from the rear.
While<br>
 they were looking in front of them some one approached them
from<br>
 behind, apparently coming out of the shop which was at their
backs.</p>

<p>The speaker looked a gentleman. He sounded like one, too.<br>
 Costume, appearance, manner, were beyond reproach--even beyond
the<br>
 criticism of two such keen critics as were these. The
glorious<br>
 attire of a London dandy was surmounted with a beautiful white
top<br>
 hat. In his buttonhole was a magnificent gardenia.</p>

<p>In age the stranger was scarcely more than a boy, and a
sunny-<br>
 faced, handsome boy at that. His cheeks were hairless, his
eyes<br>
 were blue. His smile was not only innocent, it was bland.
Never<br>
 was there a more conspicuous illustration of that repose
which<br>
 stamps the caste of Vere de Vere.</p>

<p>The duke looked at him and glowered. Mr. Dacre looked at him
and<br>
 smiled.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the duke.</p>

<p>"Ah--that is the question!" The newcomer's refined and
musical<br>
 voice breathed the very soul of affability. "I am an
individual<br>
 who is so unfortunate as to be in want of five hundred
pounds."</p>

<p>"Are you the scoundrel who sent me that infamous letter?"</p>

<p>The charming stranger never turned a hair.</p>

<p>"I am the scoundrel mentioned in that infamous letter who
wants to<br>
 accost you at the Piccadilly end of the Burlington Arcade
before<br>
 half-past five--as witness my white hat and my gardenia."</p>

<p>"Where's my wife?"</p>

<p>The stranger gently swung his stick in front of him with his
two<br>
 hands. He regarded the duke as a merry-hearted son might
regard<br>
 his father. The thing was beautiful!</p>

<p>"Her grace will be home almost as soon as you are--when you
have<br>
 given me the money which I perceive you have all ready for me
in<br>
 that scarcely elegant-looking canvas bag." He shrugged his<br>
 shoulders quite gracefully. "Unfortunately, in these matters
one<br>
 has no choice--one is forced to ask for gold."</p>

<p>"And suppose, instead of giving you what is in this canvas
bag, I<br>
 take you by the throat and choke the life right out of you?"</p>

<p>"Or suppose," amended Mr. Dacre, "that you do better, and
commend<br>
 this gentleman to the tender mercies of the first policeman
we<br>
 encounter."</p>

<p>The stranger turned to Mr. Dacre. He condescended to
become<br>
 conscious of his presence.</p>

<p>"Is this gentleman your grace's friend? Ah--Mr. Dacre, I
perceive!<br>
 I have the honor of knowing Mr. Dacre, though, possibly, I
am<br>
 unknown to him."</p>

<p>"You were--until this moment."</p>

<p>With an airy little laugh the stranger returned to the duke.
He<br>
 brushed an invisible speck of dust off the sleeve of his
coat.</p>

<p>"As has been intimated in that infamous letter, his grace is
at<br>
 perfect liberty to give me into custody--why not? Only"--he
said<br>
 it with his boyish smile--"if a particular communication is
not<br>
 received from me in certain quarters within a certain time
the<br>
 Duchess of Datchet's beautiful white arm will be hacked off at
the<br>
 shoulder."</p>

<p>"You hound!"</p>

<p>The duke would have taken the stranger by the throat, and have
done<br>
 his best to choke the life right out of him then and there, if
Mr.<br>
 Dacre had not intervened.</p>

<p>"Steady, old man!" Mr. Dacre turned to the stranger. "You
appear<br>
 to be a pretty sort of a scoundrel."</p>

<p>The stranger gave his shoulders that almost imperceptible
shrug.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Dacre, I am in want of money! I believe that
you<br>
 sometimes are in want of money, too."</p>

<p>Everybody knows that nobody knows where Ivor Dacre gets his
money<br>
 from, so the allusion must have tickled him immensely.</p>

<p>"You're a cool hand," he said.</p>

<p>"Some men are born that way."</p>

<p>"So I should imagine. Men like you must be born, not
made."</p>

<p>"Precisely--as you say!" The stranger turned, with his
graceful<br>
 smile, to the duke: "But are we not wasting precious time? I
can<br>
 assure your grace that, in this particular matter, moments are
of<br>
 value."</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre interposed before the duke could answer.</p>

<p>"If you take my strongly urged advice, Datchet, you will
summon<br>
 this constable who is now coming down the Arcade, and hand
this<br>
 gentleman over to his keeping. I do not think that you need
fear<br>
 that the duchess will lose her arm, or even her little
finger.<br>
 Scoundrels of this one's kidney are most amenable to reason
when<br>
 they have handcuffs on their wrists."</p>

<p>The duke plainly hesitated. He would--and he would not.
The<br>
 stranger, as he eyed him, seemed much amused.</p>

<p>"My dear duke, by all means act on Mr. Dacre's valuable
suggestion.<br>
 As I said before, why not? It would at least be interesting to
see<br>
 if the duchess does or does not lose her arm--almost as
interesting<br>
 to you as to Mr. Dacre. Those blackmailing, kidnaping
scoundrels<br>
 do use such empty menaces. Besides, you would have the pleasure
of<br>
 seeing me locked up. My imprisonment for life would recompense
you<br>
 even for the loss of her grace's arm. And five hundred pounds
is<br>
 such a sum to have to pay--merely for a wife! Why not,
therefore,<br>
 act on Mr. Dacre's suggestion? Here comes the constable."
The<br>
 constable referred to was advancing toward them--he was not a
dozen<br>
 yards away. "Let me beckon to him--I will with pleasure." He
took<br>
 out his watch--a gold chronograph repeater. "There are
scarcely<br>
 ten minutes left during which it will be possible for me to
send<br>
 the communication which I spoke of, so that it may arrive in
time.<br>
 As it will then be too late, and the instruments are already<br>
 prepared for the little operation which her grace is eagerly<br>
 anticipating, it would, perhaps, be as well, after all, that
you<br>
 should give me into charge. You would have saved your five
hundred<br>
 pounds, and you would, at any rate, have something in exchange
for<br>
 her grace's mutilated limb. Ah, here is the constable!
Officer!"</p>

<p>The stranger spoke with such a pleasant little air of easy<br>
 geniality that it was impossible to tell if he were in jest or
in<br>
 earnest. This fact impressed the duke much more than if he
had<br>
 gone in for a liberal indulgence of the--under the
circumstances--<br>
 orthodox melodramatic scowling. And, indeed, in the face of
his<br>
 own common sense, it impressed Mr. Ivor Dacre too.</p>

<p><br>
 This well-bred, well-groomed youth was just the being to
realize--<br>
 aux bouts des ongles--a modern type of the devil, the type
which<br>
 depicts him as a perfect gentleman, who keeps smiling all the
time.</p>

<p>The constable whom this audacious rogue had signaled
approached the<br>
 little group. He addressed the stranger:</p>

<p>"Do you want me, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not want you. I think it is the Duke of
Datchet."</p>

<p>The constable, who knew the duke very well by sight, saluted
him as<br>
 he turned to receive instructions.</p>

<p>The duke looked white, even savage. There was not a pleasant
look<br>
 in his eyes and about his lips. He appeared to be endeavoring
to<br>
 put a great restraint upon himself. There was a momentary
silence.<br>
 Mr. Dacre made a movement as if to interpose. The duke caught
him<br>
 by the arm.</p>

<p>He spoke: "No, constable, I do not want you. This person
is<br>
 mistaken."</p>

<p>The constable looked as if he could not quite make out how
such a<br>
 mistake could have arisen, hesitated, then, with another salute,
he<br>
 moved away.</p>

<p>The stranger was still holding his watch in his hand.</p>

<p>"Only eight minutes," he said.</p>

<p>The duke seemed to experience some difficulty in giving
utterance<br>
 to what he had to say.</p>

<p>"If I give you this five hundred pounds, you--you--"</p>

<p>As the duke paused, as if at a loss for language which was
strong<br>
 enough to convey his meaning, the stranger laughed.</p>

<p>"Let us take the adjectives for granted. Besides, it is only
boys<br>
 who call each other names--men do things. If you give me the
five<br>
 hundred sovereigns, which you have in that bag, at once--in
five<br>
 minutes it will be too late--I will promise--I will not swear;
if<br>
 you do not credit my simple promise, you will not believe my
solemn<br>
 affirmation--I will promise that, possibly within an hour,<br>
 certainly within an hour and a half, the Duchess of Datchet
shall<br>
 return to you absolutely uninjured--except, of course, as you
are<br>
 already aware, with regard to a few of the hairs of her head.
I<br>
 will promise this on the understanding that you do not
yourself<br>
 attempt to see where I go, and that you will allow no one else
to<br>
 do so." This with a glance at Ivor Dacre. "I shall know at
once<br>
 if I am followed. If you entertain such intentions, you had<br>
 better, on all accounts, remain in possession of your five
hundred<br>
 pounds."</p>

<p>The duke eyed him very grimly.</p>

<p>"I entertain no such intentions--until the duchess
returns."</p>

<p>Again the stranger indulged in that musical laugh of his.</p>

<p>"Ah, until the duchess returns! Of course, then the bargain's
at<br>
 an end. When you are once more in the enjoyment of her
grace's<br>
 society, you will be at liberty to set all the dogs in Europe at
my<br>
 heels. I assure you I fully expect that you will do so--why
not?"<br>
 The duke raised the canvas bag. "My dear duke, ten thousand<br>
 thanks! You shall see her grace at Datchet House, 'pon my
honor,<br>
 probably within the hour."</p>

<p>"Well," commented Ivor Dacre, when the stranger had vanished,
with<br>
 the bag, into Piccadilly, and as the duke and himself moved
toward<br>
 Burlington Gardens, "if a gentleman is to be robbed, it is as
well<br>
 that he should have another gentleman rob him."</p>

<h3><br>
 III</h3>

<p><br>
 Mr. Dacre eyed his companion covertly as they progressed.
His<br>
 Grace of Datchet appeared to have some fresh cause for
uneasiness.<br>
 All at once he gave it utterance, in a tone of voice which
was<br>
 extremely somber:</p>

<p><br>
 "Ivor, do you think that scoundrel will dare to play me
false?"</p>

<p>"I think," murmured Mr. Dacre, "that he has dared to play
you<br>
 pretty false already."</p>

<p>"I don't mean that. But I mean how am I to know, now that he
has<br>
 his money, that he will still not keep Mabel in his
clutches?"</p>

<p>There came an echo from Mr. Dacre.</p>

<p>"Just so--how are you to know?"</p>

<p>"I believe that something of this sort has been done in
the<br>
 States."</p>

<p>"I thought that there they were content to kidnap them after
they<br>
 were dead. I was not aware that they had, as yet, got quite so
far<br>
 as the living."</p>

<p>"I believe that I have heard of something just like this."</p>

<p>"Possibly; they are giants over there."</p>

<p>"And in that case the scoundrels, when their demands were
met,<br>
 refused to keep to the letter of their bargain and asked for
more."</p>

<p>The duke stood still. He clinched his fists, and swore:</p>

<p>"Ivor, if that ---- villain doesn't keep his word, and Mabel
isn't<br>
 home within the hour, by ---- I shall go mad!"</p>

<p>"My dear Datchet"--Mr. Dacre loved strong language as little
as he<br>
 loved a scene--"let us trust to time and, a little, to your
white-<br>
 hatted and gardenia-buttonholed friend's word of honor. You
should<br>
 have thought of possible eventualities before you showed
your<br>
 confidence--really. Suppose, instead of going mad, we first of
all<br>
 go home?"</p>

<p>A hansom stood waiting for a fare at the end of the Arcade.
Mr.<br>
 Dacre had handed the duke into it before his grace had quite<br>
 realized that the vehicle was there.</p>

<p>"Tell the fellow to drive faster." That was what the duke
said<br>
 when the cab had started.</p>

<p>"My dear Datchet, the man's already driving his geerage off
its<br>
 legs. If a bobby catches sight of him he'll take his
number."</p>

<p>A moment later, a murmur from the duke:</p>

<p>"I don't know if you're aware that the prince is coming to
dinner?"</p>

<p>"I am perfectly aware of it."</p>

<p>"You take it uncommonly cool. How easy it is to bear our
brother's<br>
 burdens! Ivor, if Mabel doesn't turn up I shall feel like
murder."</p>

<p>"I sympathize with you, Datchet, with all my heart, though, I
may<br>
 observe, parenthetically, that I very far from realize the<br>
 situation even yet. Take my advice. If the duchess does not
show<br>
 quite as soon as we both of us desire, don't make a scene; just
let<br>
 me see what I can do."</p>

<p>Judging from the expression of his countenance, the duke
was<br>
 conscious of no overwhelming desire to witness an exhibition of
Mr.<br>
 Dacre's prowess.</p>

<p>When the cab reached Datchet House his grace dashed up the
steps<br>
 three at a time. The door flew open.</p>

<p>"Has the duchess returned?"</p>

<p>"Hereward!"</p>

<p>A voice floated downward from above. Some one came running
down<br>
 the stairs. It was her Grace of Datchet.</p>

<p>"Mabel!"</p>

<p>She actually rushed into the duke's extended arms. And he
kissed<br>
 her, and she kissed him--before the servants.</p>

<p>"So you're not quite dead?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I am almost," he said.</p>

<p>She drew herself a little away from him.</p>

<p>"Hereward, were you seriously hurt?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that I could have been otherwise than
seriously<br>
 hurt?"</p>

<p>"My darling! Was it a Pickford's van?"</p>

<p>The duke stared.</p>

<p>"A Pickford's van? I don't understand. But come in here.
Come<br>
 along, Ivor. Mabel, you don't see Ivor."</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Dacre?"</p>

<p>Then the trio withdrew into a little anteroom; it was really
time.<br>
 Even then the pair conducted themselves as if Mr. Dacre had
been<br>
 nothing and no one. The duke took the lady's two hands in his.
He<br>
 eyed her fondly.</p>

<p>"So you are uninjured, with the exception of that lock of
hair.<br>
 Where did the villain take it from?"</p>

<p>The lady looked a little puzzled.</p>

<p>"What lock of hair?"</p>

<p>From an envelope which he took from his pocket the duke
produced a<br>
 shining tress. It was the lock of hair which had arrived in
the<br>
 first communication. "I will have it framed."</p>

<p>"You will have what framed?" The duchess glanced at what the
duke<br>
 was so tenderly caressing, almost, as it seemed, a little<br>
 dubiously. "Whatever is it you have there?"</p>

<p>"It is the lock of hair which that scoundrel sent me."
Something<br>
 in the lady's face caused him to ask a question:</p>

<p>"Didn't he tell you he had sent it to me?"</p>

<p>"Hereward!"</p>

<p>"Did the brute tell you that he meant to cut off your
little<br>
 finger?"</p>

<p>A very curious look came into the lady's face. She glanced at
the<br>
 duke as if she, all at once, was half afraid of him. She cast
at<br>
 Mr. Dacre what really seemed to be a look of inquiry. Her
voice<br>
 was tremulously anxious.</p>

<p>"Hereward, did--did the accident affect you mentally?"</p>

<p>"How could it not have affected me mentally? Do you think that
my<br>
 mental organization is of steel?"</p>

<p>"But you look so well."</p>

<p>"Of course I look well, now that I have you back again. Tell
me,<br>
 darling, did that hound actually threaten you with cutting off
your<br>
 arm? If he did, I shall feel half inclined to kill him yet."</p>

<p>The duchess seemed positively to shrink from her better half's
near<br>
 neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Hereward, was it a Pickford's van?"</p>

<p>The duke seemed puzzled. Well he might be.</p>

<p>"Was what a Pickford's van?"</p>

<p>The lady turned to Mr. Dacre. In her voice there was a ring
of<br>
 anguish.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dacre, tell me, was it a Pickford's van?" Ivor could
only<br>
 imitate his relative's repetition of her inquiry.</p>

<p>"I don't quite catch you--was what a Pickford's van?"</p>

<p>The duchess clasped her hands in front of her.</p>

<p>"What is it you are keeping from me? What is it you are trying
to<br>
 hide? I implore you to tell me the worst, whatever it may be!
Do<br>
 not keep me any longer in suspense; you do not know what I
already<br>
 have endured. Mr. Dacre, is my husband mad?"</p>

<p>One need scarcely observe that the lady's amazing appeal to
Mr.<br>
 Dacre as to her husband's sanity was received with something
like<br>
 surprise. As the duke continued to stare at her, a dreadful
fear<br>
 began to loom in his brain.</p>

<p>"My darling, your brain is unhinged!"</p>

<p>He advanced to take her two hands again in his; but, to
his<br>
 unmistakable distress, she shrank away from him.</p>

<p>"Hereward--don't touch me. How is it that I missed you? Why
did<br>
 you not wait until I came?"</p>

<p>"Wait until you came?"</p>

<p>The duke's bewilderment increased.</p>

<p>"Surely, if your injuries turned out, after all, to be slight,
that<br>
 was all the more reason why you should have waited, after
sending<br>
 for me like that."</p>

<p>"I sent for you--I?" The duke's tone was grave. "My
darling,<br>
 perhaps you had better come upstairs."</p>

<p>"Not until we have had an explanation. You must have known
that I<br>
 should come. Why did you not wait for me after you had sent
me<br>
 that?"</p>

<p>The duchess held out something to the duke. He took it. It was
a<br>
 card--his own visiting card. Something was written on the back
of<br>
 it. He read aloud what was written.</p>

<p>"'Mabel, come to me at once with the bearer. They tell me
that<br>
 they cannot take me home.' It looks like my own writing."</p>

<p>"Looks like it! It IS your writing."</p>

<p>"It looks like it--and written with a shaky pen."</p>

<p>"My dear child, one's hand would shake at such a moment as
that."</p>

<p>"Mabel, where did you get this?"</p>

<p>"It was brought to me in Cane and Wilson's."</p>

<p>"Who brought it?"</p>

<p>"Who brought it? Why, the man you sent."</p>

<p>"The man I sent!" A light burst upon the duke's brain. He
fell<br>
 back a pace. "It's the decoy!"</p>

<p>Her grace echoed the words:</p>

<p>"The decoy?"</p>

<p>"The scoundrel! To set a trap with such a bait! My poor
innocent<br>
 darling, did you think it came from me? Tell me, Mabel, where
did<br>
 he cut off your hair?"</p>

<p>"Cut off my hair?"</p>

<p>Her grace put her hand to her head as if to make sure that her
hair<br>
 was there.</p>

<p>"Where did he take you to?"</p>

<p>"He took me to Draper's Buildings."</p>

<p>"Draper's Buildings?"</p>

<p>"I have never been in the City before, but he told me it
was<br>
 Draper's Buildings. Isn't that near the Stock Exchange?"</p>

<p>"Near the Stock Exchange?"</p>

<p>It seemed rather a curious place to which to take a
kidnaped<br>
 victim. The man's audacity!</p>

<p>"He told me that you were coming out of the Stock Exchange
when a<br>
 van knocked you over. He said that he thought it was a
Pickford's<br>
 van--was it a Pickford's van?"</p>

<p>"No, it was not a Pickford's van. Mabel, were you in
Draper's<br>
 Buildings when you wrote that letter?"</p>

<p>"Wrote what letter?"</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten it already? I do not believe that there is
a<br>
 word in it which will not be branded on my brain until I
die."</p>

<p>"Hereward! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Surely you cannot have written me such a letter as that, and
then<br>
 have forgotten it already?"</p>

<p>He handed her the letter which had arrived in the second<br>
 communication. She glanced at it, askance. Then she took it
with<br>
 a little gasp.</p>

<p>"Hereward, if you don't mind, I think I'll take a chair." She
took<br>
 a chair. "Whatever--whatever's this?" As she read the letter
the<br>
 varying expressions which passed across her face were, in<br>
 themselves, a study in psychology. "Is it possible that you
can<br>
 imagine that, under any conceivable circumstances, I could
have<br>
 written such a letter as this?"</p>

<p><br>
 "Mabel!"</p>

<p>She rose to her feet with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Hereward, don't say that you thought this came from me!"</p>

<p>"Not from you?" He remembered Knowles's diplomatic reception
of<br>
 the epistle on its first appearance. "I suppose that you will
say<br>
 next that this is not a lock of your hair?"</p>

<p>"My dear child, what bee have you got in your bonnet? This a
lock<br>
 of my hair! Why, it's not in the least bit like my hair!"</p>

<p>Which was certainly inaccurate. As far as color was concerned
it<br>
 was an almost perfect match. The duke turned to Mr. Dacre.</p>

<p>"Ivor, I've had to go through a good deal this afternoon. If
I<br>
 have to go through much more, something will crack!" He
touched<br>
 his forehead. "I think it's my turn to take a chair." Not the
one<br>
 which the duchess had vacated, but one which faced it. He<br>
 stretched out his legs in front of him; he thrust his hands
into<br>
 his trousers pockets; he said, in a tone which was not gloomy
but<br>
 absolutely grewsome:</p>

<p>"Might I ask, Mabel, if you have been kidnaped?"</p>

<p>"Kidnaped?"</p>

<p>"The word I used was 'kidnaped.' But I will spell it if you
like.<br>
 Or I will get a dictionary, that you may see its meaning."</p>

<p>The duchess looked as if she was beginning to be not quite
sure if<br>
 she was awake or sleeping. She turned to Ivor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dacre, has the accident affected Hereward's brain?"</p>

<p>The duke took the words out of his cousin's mouth.</p>

<p>"On that point, my dear, let me ease your mind. I don't know
if<br>
 you are under the impression that I should be the same shape
after<br>
 a Pickford's van had run over me as I was before; but, in any
case,<br>
 I have not been run over by a Pickford's van. So far as I am<br>
 concerned there has been no accident. Dismiss that delusion
from<br>
 your mind."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"You appear surprised. One might even think that you were
sorry.<br>
 But may I now ask what you did when you arrived at Draper's<br>
 Buildings?"</p>

<p>"Did! I looked for you!"</p>

<p>"Indeed! And when you had looked in vain, what was the next
item<br>
 in your programme?"</p>

<p>The lady shrank still farther from him.</p>

<p>"Hereward, have you been having a jest at my expense? Can you
have<br>
 been so cruel?" Tears stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>Rising, the duke laid his hand upon her arm.</p>

<p>"Mabel, tell me--what did you do when you had looked for me
in<br>
 vain?"</p>

<p>"I looked for you upstairs and downstairs and everywhere. It
was<br>
 quite a large place, it took me ever such a time. I thought that
I<br>
 should go distracted. Nobody seemed to know anything about you,
or<br>
 even that there had been an accident at all--it was all offices.
I<br>
 couldn't make it out in the least, and the people didn't seem to
be<br>
 able to make me out either. So when I couldn't find you anywhere
I<br>
 came straight home again."</p>

<p>The duke was silent for a moment. Then with funereal gravity
he<br>
 turned to Mr. Dacre. He put to him this question:</p>

<p>"Ivor, what are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dacre drew his hand across his mouth with rather a
suspicious<br>
 gesture.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, only a smile!"</p>

<p>The duchess looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>"What have you two been doing? What is the joke?"</p>

<p>With an air of preternatural solemnity the duke took two
letters<br>
 from the breast pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>"Mabel, you have already seen your letter. You have already
seen<br>
 the lock of your hair. Just look at this--and that."</p>

<p>He gave her the two very singular communications which had
arrived<br>
 in such a mysterious manner, and so quickly one after the
other.<br>
 She read them with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"Hereward! Wherever did these come from?"</p>

<p>The duke was standing with his legs apart, and his hands in
his<br>
 trousers pockets. "I would give--I would give another five
hundred<br>
 pounds to know. Shall I tell you, madam, what I have been
doing?<br>
 I have been presenting five hundred golden sovereigns to a
perfect<br>
 stranger, with a top hat, and a gardenia in his buttonhole."</p>

<p>"Whatever for?"</p>

<p>"If you have perused those documents which you have in your
hand,<br>
 you will have some faint idea. Ivor, when it's your funeral,
I'LL<br>
 smile. Mabel, Duchess of Datchet, it is beginning to dawn upon
the<br>
 vacuum which represents my brain that I've been the victim of
one<br>
 of the prettiest things in practical jokes that ever yet was<br>
 planned. When that fellow brought you that card at Cane and<br>
 Wilson's--which, I need scarcely tell you, never came from
me--some<br>
 one walked out of the front entrance who was so exactly like
you<br>
 that both Barnes and Moysey took her for you. Moysey showed
her<br>
 into the carriage, and Barnes drove her home. But when the<br>
 carriage reached home it was empty. Your double had got out
upon<br>
 the road."</p>

<p>The duchess uttered a sound which was half gasp, half
sigh.</p>

<p>"Hereward!"</p>

<p>"Barnes and Moysey, with beautiful and childlike innocence,
when<br>
 they found that they had brought the thing home empty, came<br>
 straightway and told me that YOU had jumped out of the
brougham<br>
 while it had been driving full pelt through the streets. While
I<br>
 was digesting that piece of information there came the first<br>
 epistle, with the lock of your hair. Before I had time to
digest<br>
 that there came the second epistle, with yours inside."</p>

<p>"It seems incredible!"</p>

<p>"It sounds incredible; but unfathomable is the folly of
man,<br>
 especially of a man who loves his wife." The duke crossed to
Mr.<br>
 Dacre. "I don't want, Ivor, to suggest anything in the way
of<br>
 bribery and corruption, but if you could keep this matter to<br>
 yourself, and not mention it to your friends, our white-hatted
and<br>
 gardenia-buttonholed acquaintance is welcome to his five
hundred<br>
 pounds, and--Mabel, what on earth are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>The duchess appeared, all at once, to be seized with<br>
 inextinguishable laughter.</p>

<p>"Hereward," she cried, "just think how that man must be
laughing at<br>
 you!"</p>

<p>And the Duke of Datchet thought of it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>The Minor Canon</h2>

<p><br>
 It was Monday, and in the afternoon, as I was walking along
the<br>
 High Street of Marchbury, I was met by a
distinguished-looking<br>
 person whom I had observed at the services in the cathedral on
the<br>
 previous day. Now it chanced on that Sunday that I was singing
the<br>
 service. Properly speaking, it was not my turn; but, as my
brother<br>
 minor canons were either away from Marchbury or ill in bed, I
was<br>
 the only one left to perform the necessary duty. The<br>
 distinguished-looking person was a tall, big man with a round
fat<br>
 face and small features. His eyes, his hair and mustache (his
face<br>
 was bare but for a small mustache) were quite black, and he had
a<br>
 very pleasant and genial expression. He wore a tall hat, set<br>
 rather jauntily on his head, and he was dressed in black with
a<br>
 long frock coat buttoned across the chest and fitting him close
to<br>
 the body. As he came, with a half saunter, half swagger, along
the<br>
 street, I knew him again at once by his appearance; and, as he
came<br>
 nearer, I saw from his manner that he was intending to stop
and<br>
 speak to me, for he slightly raised his hat and in a soft,<br>
 melodious voice with a colonial "twang" which was far from
being<br>
 disagreeable, and which, indeed, to my ear gave a certain<br>
 additional interest to his remarks, he saluted me with "Good
day,<br>
 sir!"</p>

<p><br>
 "Good day," I answered, with just a little reserve in my
tone.</p>

<p>"I hope, sir," he began, "you will excuse my stopping you in
the<br>
 street, but I wish to tell you how very much I enjoyed the music
at<br>
 your cathedral yesterday. I am an Australian, sir, and we have
no<br>
 such music in my country."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," I said.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he went on, "nothing nearly so fine. I am very fond
of<br>
 music, and as my business brought me in this direction, I
thought I<br>
 would stop at your city and take the opportunity of paying a
visit<br>
 to your grand cathedral. And I am delighted I came; so
pleased,<br>
 indeed, that I should like to leave some memorial of my
visit<br>
 behind me. I should like, sir, to do something for your
choir."</p>

<p>"I am sure it is very kind of you," I replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should certainly be glad if you could suggest to
me<br>
 something I might do in this way. As regards money, I may say
that<br>
 I have plenty of it. I am the owner of a most valuable
property.<br>
 My business relations extend throughout the world, and if I am
as<br>
 fortunate in the projects of the future as I have been in the
past,<br>
 I shall probably one day achieve the proud position of being
the<br>
 richest man in the world."</p>

<p>I did not like to undertake myself the responsibility of
advising<br>
 or suggesting, so I simply said:</p>

<p>"I cannot venture to say, offhand, what would be the most<br>
 acceptable way of showing your great kindness and generosity,
but I<br>
 should certainly recommend you to put yourself in
communication<br>
 with the dean."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said my Australian friend, "I will do so.
And<br>
 now, sir," he continued, "let me say how much I admire your
voice.<br>
 It is, without exception, the very finest and clearest voice I
have<br>
 ever heard."</p>

<p>"Really," I answered, quite overcome with such unqualified
praise,<br>
 "really it is very good of you to say so."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I feel it, my dear sir. I have been round the world,
from<br>
 Sydney to Frisco, across the continent of America" (he called
it<br>
 Amerrker) "to New York City, then on to England, and to-morrow
I<br>
 shall leave your city to continue my travels. But in all my<br>
 experience I have never heard so grand a voice as your own."</p>

<p>This and a great deal more he said in the same strain,
which<br>
 modesty forbids me to reproduce.</p>

<p>Now I am not without some knowledge of the world outside the
close<br>
 of Marchbury Cathedral, and I could not listen to such a<br>
 "flattering tale" without having my suspicions aroused. Who
and<br>
 what is this man? thought I. I looked at him narrowly. At
first<br>
 the thought flashed across me that he might be a "swell
mobsman."<br>
 But no, his face was too good for that; besides, no man with
that<br>
 huge frame, that personality so marked and so easily
recognizable,<br>
 could be a swindler; he could not escape detection a single
hour.<br>
 I dismissed the ungenerous thought. Perhaps he is rich, as
he<br>
 says. We do hear of munificent donations by benevolent<br>
 millionaires now and then. What if this Australian, attracted
by<br>
 the glories of the old cathedral, should now appear as a deus
ex<br>
 machina to reendow the choir, or to found a musical
professoriate<br>
 in connection with the choir, appointing me the first occupant
of<br>
 the professorial chair?</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed across my mind in the momentary pause
of his<br>
 fluent tongue.</p>

<p>"As for yourself, sir," he began again, "I have something
to<br>
 propose which I trust may not prove unwelcome. But the
public<br>
 street is hardly a suitable place to discuss my proposal. May
I<br>
 call upon you this evening at your house in the close? I
know<br>
 which it is, for I happened to see you go into it yesterday
after<br>
 the morning service."</p>

<p>"I shall be very pleased to see you," I replied. "We are going
out<br>
 to dinner this evening, but I shall be at home and disengaged
till<br>
 about seven."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. Then I shall do myself the pleasure
of<br>
 calling upon you about six o'clock. Till then, farewell!" A<br>
 graceful wave of the hand, and my unknown friend had
disappeared<br>
 round the corner of the street.</p>

<p>Now at last, I thought, something is going to happen in my<br>
 uneventful life--something to break the monotony of existence.
Of<br>
 course, he must have inquired my name--he could get that from
any<br>
 of the cathedral vergers--and, as he said, he had observed<br>
 whereabouts in the close I lived. What is he coming to see me
for?<br>
 I wondered. I spent the rest of the afternoon in making the<br>
 wildest surmises. I was castle-building in Spain at a
furious<br>
 rate. At one time I imagined that this faithful son of the
church--<br>
 as he appeared to me--was going to build and endow a grand<br>
 cathedral in Australia on condition that I should be appointed
dean<br>
 at a yearly stipend of, say, ten thousand pounds. Or perhaps,
I<br>
 said to myself, he will beg me to accept a sum of money--I
never<br>
 thought of it as less than a thousand pounds--as a slight<br>
 recognition of and tribute to my remarkable vocal ability.</p>

<p>I took a long, lonely walk into the country to correct
these<br>
 ridiculous fancies and to steady my mind, and when I reached
home<br>
 and had refreshed myself with a quiet cup of afternoon tea, I
felt<br>
 I was morally and physically prepared for my interview with
the<br>
 opulent stranger.</p>

<p>Punctually as the cathedral clock struck six there was a ring
at<br>
 the visitor's bell. In a moment or two my unknown friend was
shown<br>
 into the drawing-room, which he entered with the easy air of a
man<br>
 of the world. I noticed he was carrying a small black bag.</p>

<p>"How do you do again, Mr. Dale?" he said as though we were
old<br>
 acquaintances; "you see I have come sharp to my time."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, "and I am pleased to see you; do sit down."
He<br>
 sank into my best armchair, and placed his bag on the floor
beside<br>
 him.</p>

<p>"Since we met in the afternoon," he said, "I have written a
letter<br>
 to your dean, expressing the great pleasure I felt in listening
to<br>
 your choir, and at the same time I inclosed a five-pound
note,<br>
 which I begged him to divide among the choir boys and men,
from<br>
 Alexander Poulter, Esq., of Poulter's Pills. You have of
course<br>
 heard of the world-renowned Poulter's Pills. I am Poulter!"</p>

<p>Poulter of Poulter's Pills! My heart sank within me! A
five-pound<br>
 note! My airy castles were tottering!</p>

<p>"I also sent him a couple of hundred of my pamphlets, which I
said<br>
 I trusted he would be so kind as to distribute in the
close."</p>

<p>I was aghast!</p>

<p>"And now, with regard to the special object of my call, Mr.
Dale.<br>
 If you will allow me to say so, you are not making the most of
that<br>
 grand voice of yours; you are hidden under an ecclesiastical
bushel<br>
 here--lost to the world. You are wasting your vocal strength
and<br>
 sweetness on the desert air, so to speak. Why, if I may hazard
a<br>
 guess, I don't suppose you make five hundred a year here, at
the<br>
 outside?</p>

<p>I could say nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, now, I can put you into the way of making at least
three or<br>
 four times as much as that. Listen! I am Alexander Poulter,
of<br>
 Poulter's Pills. I have a proposal to make to you. The scheme
is<br>
 bound to succeed, but I want your help. Accept my proposal
and<br>
 your fortune's made. Did you ever hear Moody and Sankey?" he
asked<br>
 abruptly.</p>

<p>The man is an idiot, thought I; he is now fairly carried away
with<br>
 his particular mania. Will it last long? Shall I ring?</p>

<p>"Novelty, my dear sir," he went on, "is the rule of the day;
and<br>
 there must be novelty in advertising, as in everything else,
to<br>
 catch the public interest. So I intend to go on a tour,
lecturing<br>
 on the merits of Poulter's Pills in all the principal halls of
all<br>
 the principal towns all over the world. But I have been delayed
in<br>
 carrying out my idea till I could associate myself with a
gentleman<br>
 such as yourself. Will you join me? I should be the Moody of
the<br>
 tour; you would be its Sankey. I would speak my patter, and
you<br>
 would intersperse my orations with melodious ballads bearing
upon<br>
 the virtues of Poulter's Pills. The ballads are all ready!"</p>

<p>So saying, he opened that bag and drew forth from its
recesses<br>
 nothing more alarming than a thick roll of manuscript music.</p>

<p>"The verses are my own," he said, with a little touch of
pride;<br>
 "and as for the music, I thought it better to make use of
popular<br>
 melodies, so as to enable an audience to join in the chorus.
See,<br>
 here is one of the ballads: 'Darling, I am better now.' It<br>
 describes the woes of a fond lover, or rather his physical<br>
 ailments, until he went through a course of Poulter. Here's<br>
 another: 'I'm ninety-five! I'm ninety-five!' You catch the
drift<br>
 of that, of course--a healthy old age, secured by taking
Poulter's<br>
 Pills. Ah! what's this? 'Little sister's last request.' I
fancy<br>
 the idea of that is to beg the family never to be without
Poulter's<br>
 Pills. Here again: 'Then you'll remember me!' I'm afraid
that<br>
 title is not original; never mind, the song is. And here
is--but<br>
 there are many more, and I won't detain you with them now."
He<br>
 saw, perhaps, I was getting impatient. Thank Heaven, however,
he<br>
 was no escaped lunatic. I was safe!</p>

<p>"Mr. Poulter," said I, "I took you this afternoon for a<br>
 disinterested and philanthropic millionaire; you take me
for--for--<br>
 something different from what I am. We have both made
mistakes.<br>
 In a word, it is impossible for me to accept your offer!"</p>

<p>"Is that final?" asked Poulter.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said I.</p>

<p>Poulter gathered his manuscripts together and replaced them in
the<br>
 bag, and got up to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Dale," he said mournfully, as I opened the
door<br>
 of the room. "Good evening"--he kept on talking till he was
fairly<br>
 out of the house--"mark my words, you'll be sorry--very
sorry--one<br>
 day that you did not fall in with my scheme. Offers like
mine<br>
 don't come every day, and you will one day regret having
refused<br>
 it."</p>

<p>With these words he left the house.</p>

<p>I had little appetite for my dinner that evening.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>The Pipe</h2>

<p><br>
 "RANDOLPH CRESCENT, N. W.</p>

<p>MY DEAR PUGH--I hope you will like the pipe which I send with
this.<br>
 It is rather a curious example of a certain school of Indian<br>
 carving. And is a present from</p>

<p>"Yours truly, JOSEPH TRESS."</p>

<p><br>
 It was really very handsome of Tress--very handsome! The
more<br>
 especially as I was aware that to give presents was not exactly
in<br>
 Tress's line. The truth is that when I saw what manner of pipe
it<br>
 was I was amazed. It was contained in a sandalwood box, which
was<br>
 itself illustrated with some remarkable specimens of carving.
I<br>
 use the word "remarkable" advisedly, because, although the<br>
 workmanship was undoubtedly, in its way, artistic, the result
could<br>
 not be described as beautiful. The carver had thought proper
to<br>
 ornament the box with some of the ugliest figures I remember
to<br>
 have seen. They appeared to me to be devils. Or perhaps they
were<br>
 intended to represent deities appertaining to some
mythological<br>
 system with which, thank goodness, I am unacquainted. The
pipe<br>
 itself was worthy of the case in which it was contained. It was
of<br>
 meerschaum, with an amber mouthpiece. It was rather too large
for<br>
 ordinary smoking. But then, of course, one doesn't smoke a
pipe<br>
 like that. There are pipes in my collection which I should as
soon<br>
 think of smoking as I should of eating. Ask a china maniac to
let<br>
 you have afternoon tea out of his Old Chelsea, and you will
learn<br>
 some home truths as to the durability of human friendships.
The<br>
 glory of the pipe, as Tress had suggested, lay in its carving.
Not<br>
 that I claim that it was beautiful, any more than I make such
a<br>
 claim for the carving on the box, but, as Tress said in his
note,<br>
 it was curious.</p>

<p><br>
 The stem and the bowl were quite plain, but on the edge of the
bowl<br>
 was perched some kind of lizard. I told myself it was an
octopus<br>
 when I first saw it, but I have since had reason to believe that
it<br>
 was some almost unique member of the lizard tribe. The
creature<br>
 was represented as climbing over the edge of the bowl down
toward<br>
 the stem, and its legs, or feelers, or tentacula, or whatever
the<br>
 things are called, were, if I may use a vulgarism, sprawling
about<br>
 "all over the place." For instance, two or three of them
were<br>
 twined about the bowl, two or three of them were twisted round
the<br>
 stem, and one, a particularly horrible one, was uplifted in
the<br>
 air, so that if you put the pipe in your mouth the thing was<br>
 pointing straight at your nose.</p>

<p>Not the least agreeable feature about the creature was that it
was<br>
 hideously lifelike. It appeared to have been carved in amber,
but<br>
 some coloring matter must have been introduced, for inside
the<br>
 amber the creature was of a peculiarly ghastly green. The more
I<br>
 examined the pipe the more amazed I was at Tress's generosity.
He<br>
 and I are rival collectors. I am not going to say, in so
many<br>
 words, that his collection of pipes contains nothing but
rubbish,<br>
 because, as a matter of fact, he has two or three rather
decent<br>
 specimens. But to compare his collection to mine would be
absurd.<br>
 Tress is conscious of this, and he resents it. He resents it
to<br>
 such an extent that he has been known, at least on one occasion,
to<br>
 declare that one single pipe of his--I believe he alluded to
the<br>
 Brummagem relic preposterously attributed to Sir Walter
Raleigh--<br>
 was worth the whole of my collection put together. Although I
have<br>
 forgotten this, as I hope I always shall forgive remarks made
when<br>
 envious passions get the better of our nobler nature, even of
a<br>
 Joseph Tress, it is not to be supposed that I have forgotten
it.<br>
 He was, therefore, not at all the sort of person from whom I<br>
 expected to receive a present. And such a present! I do not<br>
 believe that he himself had a finer pipe in his collection. And
to<br>
 have given it to me! I had misjudged the man. I wondered where
he<br>
 had got it from. I had seen his pipes; I knew them off by
heart--<br>
 and some nice trumpery he has among them, too! but I had never
seen<br>
 THAT pipe before. The more I looked at it, the more my
amazement<br>
 grew. The beast perched upon the edge of the bowl was so
lifelike.<br>
 Its two bead-like eyes seemed to gleam at me with positively
human<br>
 intelligence. The pipe fascinated me to such an extent that
I<br>
 actually resolved to--smoke it!</p>

<p>I filled it with Perique. Ordinarily I use Birdseye, but on
those<br>
 very rare occasions on which I use a specimen I smoke Perique.
I<br>
 lit up with quite a small sensation of excitement. As I did so
I<br>
 kept my eyes perforce fixed upon the beast. The beast pointed
its<br>
 upraised tentacle directly at me. As I inhaled the pungent
tobacco<br>
 that tentacle impressed me with a feeling of actual
uncanniness.<br>
 It was broad daylight, and I was smoking in front of the
window,<br>
 yet to such an extent was I affected that it seemed to me that
the<br>
 tentacle was not only vibrating, which, owing to the peculiarity
of<br>
 its position, was quite within the range of probability, but<br>
 actually moving, elongating--stretching forward, that is,
farther<br>
 toward me, and toward the tip of my nose. So impressed was I
by<br>
 this idea that I took the pipe out of my mouth and minutely<br>
 examined the beast. Really, the delusion was excusable. So<br>
 cunningly had the artist wrought that he succeeded in producing
a<br>
 creature which, such was its uncanniness, I could only hope had
no<br>
 original in nature.</p>

<p>Replacing the pipe between my lips I took several whiffs.
Never<br>
 had smoking had such an effect on me before. Either the pipe,
or<br>
 the creature on it, exercised some singular fascination. I
seemed,<br>
 without an instant's warning, to be passing into some land
of<br>
 dreams. I saw the beast, which was perched upon the bowl,
writhe<br>
 and twist. I saw it lift itself bodily from the meerschaum.</p>

<h3><br>
 II</h3>

<p><br>
 "Feeling better now?"</p>

<p>I looked up. Joseph Tress was speaking.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Have I been ill?"</p>

<p>"You appear to have been in some kind of swoon." Tress's tone
was<br>
 peculiar, even a little dry.</p>

<p><br>
 "Swoon! I never was guilty of such a thing in my life."</p>

<p>"Nor was I, until I smoked that pipe."</p>

<p>I sat up. The act of sitting up made me conscious of the fact
that<br>
 I had been lying down. Conscious, too, that I was feeling
more<br>
 than a little dazed. It seemed as though I was waking out of
some<br>
 strange, lethargic sleep--a kind of feeling which I have read
of<br>
 and heard about, but never before experienced.</p>

<p>"Where am I?"</p>

<p>"You're on the couch in your own room. You WERE on the floor;
but<br>
 I thought it would be better to pick you up and place you on
the<br>
 couch--though no one performed the same kind office to me when
I<br>
 was on the floor."</p>

<p>Again Tress's tone was distinctly dry.</p>

<p>"How came YOU here?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's the question." He rubbed his chin--a habit of
his<br>
 which has annoyed me more than once before. "Do you think
you're<br>
 sufficiently recovered to enable you to understand a little
simple<br>
 explanation?" I stared at him, amazed. He went on stroking
his<br>
 chin. "The truth is that when I sent you the pipe I made a
slight<br>
 omission."</p>

<p>"An omission?"</p>

<p>"I omitted to advise you not to smoke it."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Because--well, I've reason to believe the thing is
drugged."</p>

<p>"Drugged!"</p>

<p>"Or poisoned."</p>

<p>"Poisoned!" I was wide awake enough then. I jumped off the
couch<br>
 with a celerity which proved it.</p>

<p>"It is this way. I became its owner in rather a singular
manner."<br>
 He paused, as if for me to make a remark; but I was silent. "It
is<br>
 not often that I smoke a specimen, but, for some reason, I
did<br>
 smoke this. I commenced to smoke it, that is. How long I<br>
 continued to smoke it is more than I can say. It had on me
the<br>
 same peculiar effect which it appears to have had on you. When
I<br>
 recovered consciousness I was lying on the floor."</p>

<p>"On the floor?"</p>

<p>"On the floor. In about as uncomfortable a position as you
can<br>
 easily conceive. I was lying face downward, with my legs
bent<br>
 under me. I was never so surprised in my life as I was when
I<br>
 found myself WHERE I was. At first I supposed that I had had
a<br>
 stroke. But by degrees it dawned upon me that I didn't FEEL
as<br>
 though I had had a stroke." Tress, by the way, has been an
army<br>
 surgeon. "I was conscious of distinct nausea. Looking about,
I<br>
 saw the pipe. With me it had fallen on to the floor. I took
it<br>
 for granted, considering the delicacy of the carving, that the
fall<br>
 had broken it. But when I picked it up I found it quite
uninjured.<br>
 While I was examining it a thought flashed to my brain. Might
it<br>
 not be answerable for what had happened to me? Suppose, for<br>
 instance, it was drugged? I had heard of such things. Besides,
in<br>
 my case were present all the symptoms of drug poisoning,
though<br>
 what drug had been used I couldn't in the least conceive. I<br>
 resolved that I would give the pipe another trial."</p>

<p>"On yourself? or on another party, meaning me?"</p>

<p>"On myself, my dear Pugh--on myself! At that point of my<br>
 investigations I had not begun to think of you. I lit up and
had<br>
 another smoke."</p>

<p>"With what result?"</p>

<p>"Well, that depends on the standpoint from which you regard
the<br>
 thing. From one point of view the result was wholly
satisfactory--<br>
 I proved that the thing was drugged, and more."</p>

<p>"Did you have another fall?"</p>

<p>"I did. And something else besides."</p>

<p>"On that account, I presume, you resolved to pass the treasure
on<br>
 to me?"</p>

<p>"Partly on that account, and partly on another."</p>

<p>"On my word, I appreciate your generosity. You might have
labeled<br>
 the thing as poison."</p>

<p>"Exactly. But then you must remember how often you have told
me<br>
 that you NEVER smoke your specimens."</p>

<p>"That was no reason why you shouldn't have given me a hint
that the<br>
 thing was more dangerous than dynamite."</p>

<p>"That did occur to me afterwards. Therefore I called to supply
the<br>
 slight omission."</p>

<p>"SLIGHT omission, you call it! I wonder what you would have
called<br>
 it if you had found me dead."</p>

<p>"If I had known that you INTENDED smoking it I should not have
been<br>
 at all surprised if I had."</p>

<p>"Really, Tress, I appreciate your kindness more and more!
And<br>
 where is this example of your splendid benevolence? Have you<br>
 pocketed it, regretting your lapse into the unaccustomed paths
of<br>
 generosity? Or is it smashed to atoms?"</p>

<p>"Neither the one nor the other. You will find the pipe upon
the<br>
 table. I neither desire its restoration nor is it in any way<br>
 injured. It is merely an expression of personal opinion when I
say<br>
 that I don't believe that it COULD be injured. Of course,
having<br>
 discovered its deleterious properties, you will not want to
smoke<br>
 it again. You will therefore be able to enjoy the consciousness
of<br>
 being the possessor of what I honestly believe to be the
most<br>
 remarkable pipe in existence. Good day, Pugh."</p>

<p>He was gone before I could say a word. I immediately
concluded,<br>
 from the precipitancy of his flight, that the pipe WAS
injured.<br>
 But when I subjected it to close examination I could discover
no<br>
 signs of damage. While I was still eying it with jealous
scrutiny<br>
 the door reopened, and Tress came in again.</p>

<p>"By the way, Pugh, there is one thing I might mention,
especially<br>
 as I know it won't make any difference to you."</p>

<p>"That depends on what it is. If you have changed your mind,
and<br>
 want the pipe back again, I tell you frankly that it won't. In
my<br>
 opinion, a thing once given is given for good."</p>

<p>"Quite so; I don't want it back again. You may make your mind
easy<br>
 on that point. I merely wanted to tell you WHY I gave it
you."</p>

<p>"You have told me that already."</p>

<p>"Only partly, my dear Pugh--only partly. You don't suppose
I<br>
 should have given you such a pipe as that merely because it<br>
 happened to be drugged? Scarcely! I gave it you because I<br>
 discovered from indisputable evidence, and to my cost, that it
was<br>
 haunted."</p>

<p>"Haunted?"</p>

<p>"Yes, haunted. Good day."</p>

<p>He was gone again. I ran out of the room, and shouted after
him<br>
 down the stairs. He was already at the bottom of the flight.</p>

<p>"Tress! Come back! What do you mean by talking such
nonsense?"</p>

<p>"Of course it's only nonsense. We know that that sort of
thing<br>
 always is nonsense. But if you should have reason to suppose
that<br>
 there is something in it besides nonsense, you may think it
worth<br>
 your while to make inquiries of me, But I won't have that pipe
back<br>
 again in my possession on any terms--mind that!"</p>

<p>The bang of the front door told me that he had gone out into
the<br>
 street. I let him go. I laughed to myself as I reentered the<br>
 room. Haunted! That was not a bad idea of his. I saw the
whole<br>
 position at a glance. The truth of the matter was that he
did<br>
 regret his generosity, and he was ready to go any lengths if
he<br>
 could only succeed in cajoling me into restoring his gift. He
was<br>
 aware that I have views upon certain matters which are not
wholly<br>
 in accordance with those which are popularly supposed to be
the<br>
 views of the day, and particularly that on the question of what
are<br>
 commonly called supernatural visitations I have a standpoint of
my<br>
 own. Therefore, it was not a bad move on his part to try to
make<br>
 me believe that about the pipe on which he knew I had set my
heart<br>
 there was something which could not be accounted for by
ordinary<br>
 laws. Yet, as his own sense would have told him it would do, if
he<br>
 had only allowed himself to reflect for a moment, the move
failed.<br>
 Because I am not yet so far gone as to suppose that a pipe, a
thing<br>
 of meerschaum and of amber, in the sense in which I understand
the<br>
 word, COULD be haunted--a pipe, a mere pipe.</p>

<p>"Hollo! I thought the creature's legs were twined right round
the<br>
 bowl!"</p>

<p>I was holding the pipe in my hand, regarding it with the<br>
 affectionate eyes with which a connoisseur does regard a
curio,<br>
 when I was induced to make this exclamation. I was certainly
under<br>
 the impression that, when I first took the pipe out of the
box,<br>
 two, if not three of the feelers had been twined about the
bowl--<br>
 twined TIGHTLY, so that you could not see daylight between them
and<br>
 it. Now they were almost entirely detached, only the tips
touching<br>
 the meerschaum, and those particular feelers were gathered up
as<br>
 though the creature were in the act of taking a spring. Of
course<br>
 I was under a misapprehension: the feelers COULDN'T have
been<br>
 twined; a moment before I should have been ready to bet a
thousand<br>
 to one that they were. Still, one does make mistakes, and
very<br>
 egregious mistakes, at times. At the same time, I confess
that<br>
 when I saw that dreadful-looking animal poised on the extreme
edge<br>
 of the bowl, for all the world as though it were just going
to<br>
 spring at me, I was a little startled. I remembered that when
I<br>
 was smoking the pipe I did think I saw the uplifted tentacle<br>
 moving, as though it were reaching out to me. And I had a
clear<br>
 recollection that just as I had been sinking into that
strange<br>
 state of unconsciousness, I had been under the impression that
the<br>
 creature was writhing and twisting, as though it had
suddenly<br>
 become instinct with life. Under the circumstances, these<br>
 reflections were not pleasant. I wished Tress had not talked
that<br>
 nonsense about the thing being haunted. It was surely
sufficient<br>
 to know that it was drugged and poisonous, without anything
else.</p>

<p>I replaced it in the sandalwood box. I locked the box in a<br>
 cabinet. Quite apart from the question as to whether that pipe
was<br>
 or was not haunted, I know it haunted me. It was with me in
a<br>
 figurative--which was worse than actual--sense all the day.
Still<br>
 worse, it was with me all the night. It was with me in my
dreams.<br>
 Such dreams! Possibly I had not yet wholly recovered from
the<br>
 effects of that insidious drug, but, whether or no, it was
very<br>
 wrong of Tress to set my thoughts into such a channel. He
knows<br>
 that I am of a highly imaginative temperament, and that it
is<br>
 easier to get morbid thoughts into my mind than to get them
out<br>
 again. Before that night was through I wished very heartily that
I<br>
 had never seen the pipe! I woke from one nightmare to fall
into<br>
 another. One dreadful dream was with me all the time--of a<br>
 hideous, green reptile which advanced toward me out of some
awful<br>
 darkness, slowly, inch by inch, until it clutched me round
the<br>
 neck, and, gluing its lips to mine, sucked the life's blood out
of<br>
 my veins as it embraced me with a slimy kiss. Such dreams are
not<br>
 restful. I woke anything but refreshed when the morning came.
And<br>
 when I got up and dressed I felt that, on the whole, it
would<br>
 perhaps have been better if I never had gone to bed. My
nerves<br>
 were unstrung, and I had that generally tremulous feeling which
is,<br>
 I believe, an inseparable companion of the more advanced stages
of<br>
 dipsomania. I ate no breakfast. I am no breakfast eater as a<br>
 rule, but that morning I ate absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>"If this sort of thing is to continue, I will let Tress have
his<br>
 pipe again. He may have the laugh of me, but anything is
better<br>
 than this."</p>

<p>It was with almost funereal forebodings that I went to the
cabinet<br>
 in which I had placed the sandalwood box. But when I opened it
my<br>
 feelings of gloom partially vanished. Of what phantasies had
I<br>
 been guilty! It must have been an entire delusion on my part
to<br>
 have supposed that those tentacula had ever been twined about
the<br>
 bowl. The creature was in exactly the same position in which I
had<br>
 left it the day before--as, of course, I knew it would
be--poised,<br>
 as if about to spring. I was telling myself how foolish I had
been<br>
 to allow myself to dwell for a moment on Tress's words, when
Martin<br>
 Brasher was shown in.</p>

<p>Brasher is an old friend of mine. We have a common
ground--ghosts.<br>
 Only we approach them from different points of view. He takes
the<br>
 scientific--psychological--inquiry side. He is always anxious
to<br>
 hear of a ghost, so that he may have an opportunity of "showing
it<br>
 up."</p>

<p>"I've something in your line here," I observed, as he came
in.</p>

<p>"In my line? How so? I'M not pipe mad."</p>

<p>"No; but you're ghost mad. And this is a haunted pipe."</p>

<p>"A haunted pipe! I think you're rather more mad about ghosts,
my<br>
 dear Pugh, than I am."</p>

<p>Then I told him all about it. He was deeply interested,
especially<br>
 when I told him that the pipe was drugged. But when I
repeated<br>
 Tress's words about its being haunted, and mentioned my own<br>
 delusion about the creature moving, he took a more serious view
of<br>
 the case than I had expected he would do.</p>

<p>"I propose that we act on Tress's suggestion, and go and
make<br>
 inquiries of him."</p>

<p>"But you don't really think that there is anything in it?"</p>

<p>"On these subjects I never allow myself to think at all. There
are<br>
 Tress's words, and there is your story. It is agreed on all
hands<br>
 that the pipe has peculiar properties. It seems to me that
there<br>
 is a sufficient case here to merit inquiry."</p>

<p>He persuaded me. I went with him. The pipe, in the
sandalwood<br>
 box, went too. Tress received us with a grin--a grin which
was<br>
 accentuated when I placed the sandalwood box on the table.</p>

<p>"You understand," he said, "that a gift is a gift. On no
terms<br>
 will I consent to receive that pipe back in my possession."</p>

<p>I was rather nettled by his tone.</p>

<p>"You need be under no alarm. I have no intention of
suggesting<br>
 anything of the kind."</p>

<p>"Our business here," began Brasher--I must own that his manner
is a<br>
 little ponderous--"is of a scientific, I may say also, and at
the<br>
 same time, of a judicial nature. Our object is the Pursuit
of<br>
 Truth and the Advancement of Inquiry."</p>

<p>"Have you been trying another smoke?" inquired Tress, nodding
his<br>
 head toward me.</p>

<p>Before I had time to answer, Brasher went droning on:</p>

<p>"Our friend here tells me that you say this pipe is
haunted."</p>

<p>"I say it is haunted because it IS haunted."</p>

<p>I looked at Tress. I half suspected that he was poking fun at
us.<br>
 But he appeared to be serious enough.</p>

<p>"In these matters," remarked Brasher, as though he were
giving<br>
 utterance to a new and important truth, "there is a scientific
and<br>
 nonscientific method of inquiry. The scientific method is to
begin<br>
 at the beginning. May I ask how this pipe came into your<br>
 possession?"</p>

<p>Tress paused before he answered.</p>

<p>"You may ask." He paused again. "Oh, you certainly may ask.
But<br>
 it doesn't follow that I shall tell you."</p>

<p>"Surely your object, like ours, can be but the Spreading About
of<br>
 the Truth?"</p>

<p>"I don't see it at all. It is possible to imagine a case in
which<br>
 the spreading about of the truth might make me look a little<br>
 awkward."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Brasher pursed up his lips. "Your words would
almost<br>
 lead one to suppose that there was something about your method
of<br>
 acquiring the pipe which you have good and weighty reasons
for<br>
 concealing."</p>

<p><br>
 "I don't know why I should conceal the thing from you. I
don't<br>
 suppose either of you is any better than I am. I don't mind<br>
 telling you how I got the pipe. I stole it."</p>

<p>"Stole it!"</p>

<p>Brasher seemed both amazed and shocked. But I, who had
previous<br>
 experience of Tress's methods of adding to his collection, was
not<br>
 at all surprised. Some of the pipes which he calls his, if
only<br>
 the whole truth about them were publicly known, would send him
to<br>
 jail.</p>

<p>"That's nothing!" he continued. "All collectors steal! The
eighth<br>
 commandment was not intended to apply to them. Why, Pugh there
has<br>
 'conveyed' three fourths of the pipes which he flatters himself
are<br>
 his."</p>

<p>I was so dumfoundered by the charge that it took my breath
away. I<br>
 sat in astounded silence. Tress went raving on:</p>

<p>"I was so shy of this particular pipe when I had obtained it,
that<br>
 I put it away for quite three months. When I took it out to have
a<br>
 look at it something about the thing so tickled me that I
resolved<br>
 to smoke it. Owing to peculiar circumstances attending the
manner<br>
 in which the thing came into my possession, and on which I need
not<br>
 dwell--you don't like to dwell on those sort of things, do
you,<br>
 Pugh?--I knew really nothing about the pipe. As was the case
with<br>
 Pugh, one peculiarity I learned from actual experience. It
was<br>
 also from actual experience that I learned that the thing
was--<br>
 well, I said haunted, but you may use any other word you
like."</p>

<p>"Tell us, as briefly as possible, what it was you really
did<br>
 discover."</p>

<p>"Take the pipe out of the box!" Brasher took the pipe out of
the<br>
 box and held it in his hand. "You see that creature on it.
Well,<br>
 when I first had it it was underneath the pipe."</p>

<p>"How do you mean that it was underneath the pipe?"</p>

<p>"It was bunched together underneath the stem, just at the end
of<br>
 the mouthpiece, in the same way in which a fly might be
suspended<br>
 from the ceiling. When I began to smoke the pipe I saw the<br>
 creature move."</p>

<p>"But I thought that unconsciousness immediately followed."</p>

<p>"It did follow, but not before I saw that the thing was
moving. It<br>
 was because I thought that I had been, in a way, a victim of<br>
 delirium that I tried the second smoke. Suspecting that the
thing<br>
 was drugged I swallowed what I believed would prove a
powerful<br>
 antidote. It enabled me to resist the influence of the
narcotic<br>
 much longer than before, and while I still retained my senses I
saw<br>
 the creature crawl along under the stem and over the bowl. It
was<br>
 that sight, I believe, as much as anything else, which sent
me<br>
 silly. When I came to I then and there decided to present the
pipe<br>
 to Pugh. There is one more thing I would remark. When the
pipe<br>
 left me the creature's legs were twined about the bowl. Now
they<br>
 are withdrawn. Possibly you, Pugh, are able to cap my story with
a<br>
 little one which is all your own."</p>

<p>"I certainly did imagine that I saw the creature move. But
I<br>
 supposed that while I was under the influence of the drug<br>
 imagination had played me a trick."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! Depend upon it, the beast is bewitched. Even
to<br>
 my eye it looks as though it were, and to a trained eye like
yours,<br>
 Pugh! You've been looking for the devil a long time, and
you've<br>
 got him at last."</p>

<p>"I--I wish you wouldn't make those remarks, Tress. They jar
on<br>
 me."</p>

<p>"I confess," interpolated Brasher--I noticed that he had put
the<br>
 pipe down on the table as though he were tired of holding
it--<br>
 "that, to MY thinking, such remarks are not appropriate. At
the<br>
 same time what you have told us is, I am bound to allow, a
little<br>
 curious. But of course what I require is ocular demonstration.
I<br>
 haven't seen the movement myself."</p>

<p>"No, but you very soon will do if you care to have a pull at
the<br>
 pipe on your own account. Do, Brasher, to oblige me! There's
a<br>
 dear!"</p>

<p>"It appears, then, that the movement is only observable when
the<br>
 pipe is smoked. We have at least arrived at step No. 1."</p>

<p>"Here's a match, Brasher! Light up, and we shall have arrived
at<br>
 step No. 2."</p>

<p>Tress lit a match and held it out to Brasher. Brasher
retreated<br>
 from its neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Tress, I am no smoker, as you are aware. And
I<br>
 have no desire to acquire the art of smoking by means of a
poisoned<br>
 pipe."</p>

<p>Tress laughed. He blew out the match and threw it into the
grate.</p>

<p>"Then I tell you what I'll do--I'll have up Bob."</p>

<p>"Bob--why Bob?"</p>

<p>"Bob"--whose real name was Robert Haines, though I should
think he<br>
 must have forgotten the fact, so seldom was he addressed by
it--was<br>
 Tress's servant. He had been an old soldier, and had
accompanied<br>
 his master when he left the service. He was as depraved a<br>
 character as Tress himself. I am not sure even that he was
not<br>
 worse than his master. I shall never forget how he once
behaved<br>
 toward myself. He actually had the assurance to accuse me of<br>
 attempting to steal the Wardour Street relic which Tress
fondly<br>
 deludes himself was once the property of Sir Walter Raleigh.
The<br>
 truth is that I had slipped it with my handkerchief into my
pocket<br>
 in a fit of absence of mind. A man who could accuse ME of such
a<br>
 thing would be guilty of anything. I was therefore quite at
one<br>
 with Brasher when he asked what Bob could possibly be wanted
for.<br>
 Tress explained.</p>

<p>"I'll get him to smoke the pipe," he said.</p>

<p>Brasher and I exchanged glances, but we refrained from
speech.</p>

<p>"It won't do him any harm," said Tress.</p>

<p>"What--not a poisoned pipe?" asked Brasher.</p>

<p>"It's not poisoned--it's only drugged."</p>

<p>"ONLY drugged!"</p>

<p>"Nothing hurts Bob. He is like an ostrich. He has
digestive<br>
 organs which are peculiarly his own. It will only serve him as
it<br>
 served me--and Pugh--it will knock him over. It is all done in
the<br>
 Pursuit of Truth and for the Advancement of Inquiry."</p>

<p>I could see that Brasher did not altogether like the tone in
which<br>
 Tress repeated his words. As for me, it was not to be
supposed<br>
 that I should put myself out in a matter which in no way
concerned<br>
 me. If Tress chose to poison the man, it was his affair, not
mine.<br>
 He went to the door and shouted:</p>

<p>"Bob! Come here, you scoundrel!"</p>

<p>That is the way in which he speaks to him. No really
decent<br>
 servant would stand it. I shouldn't care to address Nalder,
my<br>
 servant, in such a way. He would give me notice on the spot.
Bob<br>
 came in. He is a great hulking fellow who is always on the
grin.<br>
 Tress had a decanter of brandy in his hand. He filled a
tumbler<br>
 with the neat spirit.</p>

<p>"Bob, what would you say to a glassful of brandy--the real
thing--<br>
 my boy?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"And what would you say to a pull at a pipe when the brandy
is<br>
 drunk!"</p>

<p>"A pipe?" The fellow is sharp enough when he likes. I saw
him<br>
 look at the pipe upon the table, and then at us, and then a
gleam<br>
 of intelligence came into his eyes. "I'd do it for a dollar,
sir."</p>

<p>"A dollar, you thief?"</p>

<p>"I meant ten shillings, sir."</p>

<p>"Ten shillings, you brazen vagabond?"</p>

<p>"I should have said a pound."</p>

<p>"A pound! Was ever the like of that! Do I understand you to
ask a<br>
 pound for taking a pull at your master's pipe?"</p>

<p>"I'm thinking that I'll have to make it two."</p>

<p>"The deuce you are! Here, Pugh, lend me a pound."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've left my purse behind."</p>

<p>"Then lend me ten shillings--Ananias!"</p>

<p>"I doubt if I have more than five."</p>

<p>"Then give me the five. And, Brasher, lend me the other
fifteen."</p>

<p>Brasher lent him the fifteen. I doubt if we shall either of
us<br>
 ever see our money again. He handed the pound to Bob.</p>

<p>"Here's the brandy--drink it up!" Bob drank it without a
word,<br>
 draining the glass of every drop. "And here's the pipe."</p>

<p>"Is it poisoned, sir?"</p>

<p>"Poisoned, you villain! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It isn't the first time I've seen your tricks, sir--is it
now?<br>
 And you're not the one to give a pound for nothing at all. If
it<br>
 kills me you'll send my body to my mother--she'd like to know
that<br>
 I was dead."</p>

<p>"Send your body to your grandmother! You idiot, sit down
and<br>
 smoke!"</p>

<p>Bob sat down. Tress had filled the pipe, and handed it, with
a<br>
 lighted match, to Bob. The fellow declined the match. He
handled<br>
 the pipe very gingerly, turning it over and over, eying it with
all<br>
 his eyes.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir--I'll light up myself if it's the same to you.
I<br>
 carry matches of my own. It's a beautiful pipe, entirely. I
never<br>
 see the like of it for ugliness. And what's the
slimy-looking<br>
 varmint that looks as though it would like to have my life? Is
it<br>
 living, or is it dead?"</p>

<p>"Come, we don't want to sit here all day, my man!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, the look of this here pipe has quite upset my
stomach.<br>
 I'd like another drop of liquor, if it's the same to you."</p>

<p>"Another drop! Why, you've had a tumblerful already!
Here's<br>
 another tumblerful to put on top of that. You won't want the
pipe<br>
 to kill you--you'll be killed before you get to it."</p>

<p>"And isn't it better to die a natural death?"</p>

<p>Bob emptied the second tumbler of brandy as though it were
water.<br>
 I believe he would empty a hogshead without turning a hair!
Then<br>
 he gave another look at the pipe. Then, taking a match from
his<br>
 waistcoat pocket, he drew a long breath, as though he were<br>
 resigning himself to fate. Striking the match on the seat of
his<br>
 trousers, while, shaded by his hand, the flame was gathering<br>
 strength, he looked at each of us in turn. When he looked at
Tress<br>
 I distinctly saw him wink his eye. What my feelings would
have<br>
 been if a servant of mine had winked his eye at me I am unable
to<br>
 imagine! The match was applied to the tobacco, a puff of
smoke<br>
 came through his lips--the pipe was alight!</p>

<p>During this process of lighting the pipe we had sat--I do not
wish<br>
 to use exaggerated language, but we had sat and watched that<br>
 alcoholic scamp's proceedings as though we were witnessing
an<br>
 action which would leave its mark upon the age. When we saw
the<br>
 pipe was lighted we gave a simultaneous start. Brasher put
his<br>
 hands under his coat tails and gave a kind of hop. I raised
myself<br>
 a good six inches from my chair, and Tress rubbed his palms<br>
 together with a chuckle. Bob alone was calm.</p>

<p>"Now," cried Tress, "you'll see the devil moving."</p>

<p>Bob took the pipe from between his lips.</p>

<p>"See what?" he said.</p>

<p>"Bob, you rascal, put that pipe back into your mouth, and
smoke it<br>
 for your life!"</p>

<p>Bob was eying the pipe askance.</p>

<p>"I dare say, but what I want to know is whether this here
varmint's<br>
 dead or whether he isn't. I don't want to have him flying at
my<br>
 nose--and he looks vicious enough for anything."</p>

<p>"Give me back that pound, you thief, and get out of my house,
and<br>
 bundle."</p>

<p>"I ain't going to give you back no pound."</p>

<p>"Then smoke that pipe!"</p>

<p>"I am smoking it, ain't I?"</p>

<p>With the utmost deliberation Bob returned the pipe to his
mouth.<br>
 He emitted another whiff or two of smoke.</p>

<p>"Now--now!" cried Tress, all excitement, and wagging his hand
in<br>
 the air.</p>

<p>We gathered round. As we did so Bob again withdrew the
pipe.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of all this here? I ain't going to have
you<br>
 playing none of your larks on me. I know there's something up,
but<br>
 I ain't going to throw my life away for twenty shillings--not
quite<br>
 I ain't."</p>

<p>Tress, whose temper is not at any time one of the best, was
seized<br>
 with quite a spasm of rage.</p>

<p>"As I live, my lad, if you try to cheat me by taking that pipe
from<br>
 between your lips until I tell you, you leave this room that<br>
 instant, never again to be a servant of mine."</p>

<p>I presume the fellow knew from long experience when his
master<br>
 meant what he said, and when he didn't. Without an attempt
at<br>
 remonstrance he replaced the pipe. He continued stolidly to
puff<br>
 away. Tress caught me by the arm.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you? There--there! That tentacle is
moving."</p>

<p>The uplifted tentacle WAS moving. It was doing what I had seen
it<br>
 do, as I supposed, in my distorted imagination--it was
reaching<br>
 forward. Undoubtedly Bob saw what it was doing; but, whether
in<br>
 obedience to his master's commands, or whether because the drug
was<br>
 already beginning to take effect, he made no movement to
withdraw<br>
 the pipe. He watched the slowly advancing tentacle, coming
closer<br>
 and closer toward his nose, with an expression of such
intense<br>
 horror on his countenance that it became quite shocking.
Farther<br>
 and farther the creature reached forward, until on a sudden,
with a<br>
 sort of jerk, the movement assumed a downward direction, and
the<br>
 tentacle was slowly lowered until the tip rested on the stem of
the<br>
 pipe. For a moment the creature remained motionless. I was<br>
 quieting my nerves with the reflection that this thing was but
some<br>
 trick of the carver's art, and that what we had seen we had seen
in<br>
 a sort of nightmare, when the whole hideous reptile was seized
with<br>
 what seemed to be a fit of convulsive shuddering. It seemed to
be<br>
 in agony. It trembled so violently that I expected to see it<br>
 loosen its hold of the stem and fall to the ground. I was<br>
 sufficiently master of myself to steal a glance at Bob. We had
had<br>
 an inkling of what might happen. He was wholly unprepared. As
he<br>
 saw that dreadful, human-looking creature, coming to life, as
it<br>
 seemed, within an inch or two of his nose, his eyes dilated
to<br>
 twice their usual size. I hoped, for his sake, that<br>
 unconsciousness would supervene, through the action of the
drug,<br>
 before through sheer fright his senses left him. Perhaps<br>
 mechanically he puffed steadily on.</p>

<p>The creature's shuddering became more violent. It appeared
to<br>
 swell before our eyes. Then, just as suddenly as it began,
the<br>
 shuddering ceased. There was another instant of quiescence.
Then<br>
 the creature began to crawl along the stem of the pipe! It
moved<br>
 with marvelous caution, the merest fraction of an inch at a
time.<br>
 But still it moved! Our eyes were riveted on it with a
fascination<br>
 which was absolutely nauseous. I am unpleasantly affected even
as<br>
 I think of it now. My dreams of the night before had been
nothing<br>
 to this.</p>

<p><br>
 Slowly, slowly, it went, nearer and nearer to the smoker's
nose.<br>
 Its mode of progression was in the highest degree unsightly.
It<br>
 glided, never, so far as I could see, removing its tentacles
from<br>
 the stem of the pipe. It slipped its hindmost feelers onward
until<br>
 they came up to those which were in advance. Then, in their
turn,<br>
 it advanced those which were in front. It seemed, too, to
move<br>
 with the utmost labor, shuddering as though it were in pain.</p>

<p>We were all, for our parts, speechless. I was momentarily
hoping<br>
 that the drug would take effect on Bob. Either his
constitution<br>
 enabled him to offer a strong resistance to narcotics, or else
the<br>
 large quantity of neat spirit which he had drunk acted--as
Tress<br>
 had malevolently intended that it should--as an antidote. It<br>
 seemed to me that he would NEVER succumb. On went the
creature--<br>
 on, and on, in its infinitesimal progression. I was spellbound.
I<br>
 would have given the world to scream, to have been able to utter
a<br>
 sound. I could do nothing else but watch.</p>

<p>The creature had reached the end of the stem. It had gained
the<br>
 amber mouthpiece. It was within an inch of the smoker's
nose.<br>
 Still on it went. It seemed to move with greater freedom on
the<br>
 amber. It increased its rate of progress. It was actually<br>
 touching the foremost feature on the smoker's countenance. I<br>
 expected to see it grip the wretched Bob, when it began to<br>
 oscillate from side to side. Its oscillations increased in<br>
 violence. It fell to the floor. That same instant the
narcotic<br>
 prevailed. Bob slipped sideways from the chair, the pipe
still<br>
 held tightly between his rigid jaws.</p>

<p>We were silent. There lay Bob. Close beside him lay the
creature.<br>
 A few more inches to the left, and he would have fallen on
and<br>
 squashed it flat. It had fallen on its back. Its feelers
were<br>
 extended upward. They were writhing and twisting and turning
in<br>
 the air.</p>

<p>Tress was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I think a little brandy won't be amiss." Emptying the
remainder<br>
 of the brandy into a glass, he swallowed it at a draught. "Now
for<br>
 a closer examination of our friend." Taking a pair of tongs
from<br>
 the grate he nipped the creature between them. He deposited
it<br>
 upon the table. "I rather fancy that this is a case for<br>
 dissection."</p>

<p>He took a penknife from his waistcoat pocket. Opening the
large<br>
 blade, he thrust its point into the object on the table. Little
or<br>
 no resistance seemed to be offered to the passage of the blade,
but<br>
 as it was inserted the tentacula simultaneously began to writhe
and<br>
 twist. Tress withdrew the knife.</p>

<p>"I thought so!" He held the blade out for our inspection.
The<br>
 point was covered with some viscid-looking matter. "That's
blood!<br>
 The thing's alive!"</p>

<p>"Alive!"</p>

<p>"Alive! That's the secret of the whole performance!"</p>

<p>"But--"</p>

<p>"But me no buts, my Pugh! The mystery's exploded! One more
ghost<br>
 is lost to the world! The person from whom I OBTAINED that
pipe<br>
 was an Indian juggler--up to many tricks of the trade. He, or
some<br>
 one for him, got hold of this sweet thing in reptiles--and a<br>
 sweeter thing would, I imagine, be hard to find--and covered
it<br>
 with some preparation of, possibly, gum arabic. He allowed this
to<br>
 harden. Then he stuck the thing--still living, for those sort
of<br>
 gentry are hard to kill--to the pipe. The consequence was
that<br>
 when anyone lit up, the warmth was communicated to the
adhesive<br>
 agent--again some preparation of gum, no doubt--it moistened
it,<br>
 and the creature, with infinite difficulty, was able to move.
But<br>
 I am open to lay odds with any gentleman of sporting tastes
that<br>
 THIS time the creature's traveling days ARE done. It has given
me<br>
 rather a larger taste of the horrors than is good for my<br>
 digestion."</p>

<p>With the aid of the tongs he removed the creature from the
table.<br>
 He placed it on the hearth. Before Brasher or I had a notion
of<br>
 what it was he intended to do he covered it with a heavy
marble<br>
 paper weight. Then he stood upon the weight, and between the<br>
 marble and the hearth he ground the creature flat.</p>

<p>While the execution was still proceeding, Bob sat up upon
the<br>
 floor.</p>

<p>"Hollo!" he asked, "what's happened?"</p>

<p>"We've emptied the bottle, Bob," said Tress. "But there's
another<br>
 where that came from. Perhaps you could drink another
tumblerful,<br>
 my boy?"</p>

<p>Bob drank it!</p>

<h4><br>
 FOOTNOTE</h4>

<p>"Those gentry are hard to kill." Here is fact, not
fantasy.<br>
 Lizard yarns no less sensational than this Mystery Story can
be<br>
 found between the covers of solemn, zoological textbooks.</p>

<p>Reptiles, indeed, are far from finicky in the matters of
air,<br>
 space, and especially warmth. Frogs and other such sluggish-<br>
 blooded creatures have lived after being frozen fast in ice.
Their<br>
 blood is little warmer than air or water, enjoying no extra
casing<br>
 of fur or feathers.</p>

<p><br>
 Air and food seem held in light esteem by lizards. Their
blood<br>
 need not be highly oxygenated; it nourishes just as well
when<br>
 impure. In temperate climes lizards lie torpid and buried
all<br>
 winter; some species of the tropic deserts sleep peacefully
all<br>
 summer. Their anatomy includes no means for the continuous<br>
 introduction and expulsion of air; reptilian lungs are little
more<br>
 than closed sacs, without cell structure.</p>

<p>If any further zoological fact were needed to verify the
denouement<br>
 of "The Pipe," it might be the general statement that lizards
are<br>
 abnormal brutes anyhow. Consider the chameleons of unsettled
hue.<br>

the<br>

 appendage?--EDITOR.</p>

<h2>The Puzzle</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><br>
 Pugh came into my room holding something wrapped in a piece
of<br>
 brown paper.</p>

<p>"Tress, I have brought you something on which you may exercise
your<br>
 ingenuity." He began, with exasperating deliberation, to untie
the<br>
 string which bound his parcel; he is one of those persons who
would<br>
 not cut a knot to save their lives. The process occupied him
the<br>
 better part of a quarter of an hour. Then he held out the
contents<br>
 of the paper.</p>

<p><br>
 "What do you think of that?" he asked. I thought nothing of
it,<br>
 and I told him so. "I was prepared for that confession. I
have<br>
 noticed, Tress, that you generally do think nothing of an
article<br>
 which really deserves the attention of a truly thoughtful
mind.<br>
 Possibly, as you think so little of it, you will be able to
solve<br>
 the puzzle."</p>

<p>I took what he held out to me. It was an oblong box, perhaps
seven<br>
 inches long by three inches broad.</p>

<p>"Where's the puzzle?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If you will examine the lid of the box, you will see." I
turned<br>
 it over and over; it was difficult to see which was the lid.
Then<br>
 I perceived that on one side were printed these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><br>
 "PUZZLE: TO OPEN THE BOX"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 The words were so faintly printed that it was not surprising
that I<br>
 had not noticed them at first. Pugh explained.</p>

<p><br>
 "I observed that box on a tray outside a second-hand
furniture<br>
 shop. It struck my eye. I took it up. I examined it. I
inquired<br>
 of the proprietor of the shop in what the puzzle lay. He
replied<br>
 that that was more than he could tell me. He himself had
made<br>
 several attempts to open the box, and all of them had failed.
I<br>
 purchased it. I took it home. I have tried, and I have failed.
I<br>
 am aware, Tress, of how you pride yourself upon your ingenuity.
I<br>
 cannot doubt that, if you try, you will not fail."</p>

<p>While Pugh was prosing, I was examining the box. It was at
least<br>
 well made. It weighed certainly under two ounces. I struck
it<br>
 with my knuckles; it sounded hollow. There was no hinge;
nothing<br>
 of any kind to show that it ever had been opened, or, for
the<br>
 matter of that, that it ever could be opened. The more I
examined<br>
 the thing, the more it whetted my curiosity. That it could
be<br>
 opened, and in some ingenious manner, I made no doubt--but
how?</p>

<p>The box was not a new one. At a rough guess I should say that
it<br>
 had been a box for a good half century; there were certain signs
of<br>
 age about it which could not escape a practiced eye. Had it<br>
 remained unopened all that time? When opened, what would be
found<br>
 inside? It SOUNDED hollow; probably nothing at all--who
could<br>
 tell?</p>

<p>It was formed of small pieces of inlaid wood. Several woods
had<br>
 been used; some of them were strange to me. They were of
different<br>
 colors; it was pretty obvious that they must all of them have
been<br>
 hard woods. The pieces were of various shapes--hexagonal,<br>
 octagonal, triangular, square, oblong, and even circular.
The<br>
 process of inlaying them had been beautifully done. So nicely
had<br>
 the parts been joined that the lines of meeting were difficult
to<br>
 discover with the naked eye; they had been joined solid, so
to<br>
 speak. It was an excellent example of marquetry. I had been
over-<br>
 hasty in my deprecation; I owed as much to Pugh.</p>

<p>"This box of yours is better worth looking at than I first<br>
 supposed. Is it to be sold?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not to be sold. Nor"--he "fixed" me with his<br>
 spectacles--"is it to be given away. I have brought it to you
for<br>
 the simple purpose of ascertaining if you have ingenuity enough
to<br>
 open it."</p>

<p>"I will engage to open it in two seconds--with a hammer."</p>

<p>"I dare say. I will open it with a hammer. The thing is to
open<br>
 it without."</p>

<p>"Let me see." I began, with the aid of a microscope, to
examine<br>
 the box more closely. "I will give you one piece of
information,<br>
 Pugh. Unless I am mistaken, the secret lies in one of these
little<br>
 pieces of inlaid wood. You push it, or you press it, or
something,<br>
 and the whole affair flies open."</p>

<p>"Such was my own first conviction. I am not so sure of it now.
I<br>
 have pressed every separate piece of wood; I have tried to
move<br>
 each piece in every direction. No result has followed. My
theory<br>
 was a hidden spring."</p>

<p>"But there must be a hidden spring of some sort, unless you
are to<br>
 open it by a mere exercise of force. I suppose the box is
empty."</p>

<p>"I thought it was at first, but now I am not so sure of
that<br>
 either. It all depends on the position in which you hold it.
Hold<br>
 it in this position--like this--close to your ear. Have you
a<br>
 small hammer?" I took a small hammer. "Tap it softly, with
the<br>
 hammer. Don't you notice a sort of reverberation within?"</p>

<p>Pugh was right, there certainly was something within;
something<br>
 which seemed to echo back my tapping, almost as if it were a
living<br>
 thing. I mentioned this, to Pugh.</p>

<p>"But you don't think that there is something alive inside the
box?<br>
 There can't be. The box must be airtight, probably as much
air-<br>
 tight as an exhausted receiver."</p>

<p>"How do we know that? How can we tell that no minute
interstices<br>
 have been left for the express purpose of ventilation?" I<br>
 continued tapping with the hammer. I noticed one peculiarity,
that<br>
 it was only when I held the box in a particular position,
and<br>
 tapped at a certain spot, there came the answering taps from<br>
 within. "I tell you what it is, Pugh, what I hear is the<br>
 reverberation of some machinery."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>"Give the box to me." Pugh put the box to his ear. He
tapped.<br>
 "It sounds to me like the echoing tick, tick of some great
beetle;<br>
 like the sort of noise which a deathwatch makes, you know."</p>

<p>Trust Pugh to find a remarkable explanation for a simple fact;
if<br>
 the explanation leans toward the supernatural, so much the
more<br>
 satisfactory to Pugh. I knew better.</p>

<p>"The sound which you hear is merely the throbbing or the
trembling<br>
 of the mechanism with which it is intended that the box should
be<br>
 opened. The mechanism is placed just where you are tapping it
with<br>
 the hammer. Every tap causes it to jar."</p>

<p>"It sounds to me like the ticking of a deathwatch. However,
on<br>
 such subjects, Tress, I know what you are."</p>

<p>"My dear Pugh, give it an extra hard tap, and you will
see."</p>

<p>He gave it an extra hard tap. The moment he had done so,
he<br>
 started.</p>

<p>"I've done it now."</p>

<p>"What have you done?"</p>

<p>"Broken something, I fancy." He listened intently, with his
ear to<br>
 the box. "No--it seems all right. And yet I could have sworn
I<br>
 had damaged something; I heard it smash."</p>

<p>"Give me the box." He gave it me. In my turn, I listened.
I<br>
 shook the box. Pugh must have been mistaken. Nothing
rattled;<br>
 there was not a sound; the box was as empty as before. I gave
a<br>
 smart tap with the hammer, as Pugh had done. Then there
certainly<br>
 was a curious sound. To my ear, it sounded like the smashing
of<br>
 glass. "I wonder if there is anything fragile inside your
precious<br>
 puzzle, Pugh, and, if so, if we are shivering it by
degrees?"</p>

<h3><br>
 II</h3>

<p><br>
 "What IS that noise?"</p>

<p>I lay in bed in that curious condition which is between sleep
and<br>
 waking. When, at last, I KNEW that I was awake, I asked
myself<br>
 what it was that had woke me. Suddenly I became conscious
that<br>
 something was making itself audible in the silence of the
night.<br>
 For some seconds I lay and listened. Then I sat up in bed.</p>

<p><br>
 "What IS that noise?"</p>

<p>It was like the tick, tick of some large and unusually
clear-toned<br>
 clock. It might have been a clock, had it not been that the
sound<br>
 was varied, every half dozen ticks or so, by a sort of
stifled<br>
 screech, such as might have been uttered by some small creature
in<br>
 an extremity of anguish. I got out of bed; it was ridiculous
to<br>
 think of sleep during the continuation of that uncanny
shrieking.<br>
 I struck a light. The sound seemed to come from the
neighborhood<br>
 of my dressing-table. I went to the dressing-table, the
lighted<br>
 match in my hand, and, as I did so, my eyes fell on Pugh's<br>
 mysterious box. That same instant there issued, from the bowels
of<br>
 the box, a more uncomfortable screech than any I had
previously<br>
 heard. It took me so completely by surprise that I let the
match<br>
 fall from my hand to the floor. The room was in darkness. I<br>
 stood, I will not say trembling, listening--considering
their<br>
 volume--to the EERIEST shrieks I ever heard. All at once
they<br>
 ceased. Then came the tick, tick, tick again. I struck
another<br>
 match and lit the gas.</p>

<p>Pugh had left his puzzle box behind him. We had done all we
could,<br>
 together, to solve the puzzle. He had left it behind to see what
I<br>
 could do with it alone. So much had it engrossed my attention
that<br>
 I had even brought it into my bedroom, in order that I
might,<br>
 before retiring to rest, make a final attempt at the solution
of<br>
 the mystery. NOW what possessed the thing?</p>

<p>As I stood, and looked, and listened, one thing began to be
clear<br>
 to me, that some sort of machinery had been set in motion
inside<br>
 the box. How it had been set in motion was another matter.
But<br>
 the box had been subjected to so much handling, to such
pressing<br>
 and such hammering, that it was not strange if, after all, Pugh
or<br>
 I had unconsciously hit upon the spring which set the whole
thing<br>
 going. Possibly the mechanism had got so rusty that it had
refused<br>
 to act at once. It had hung fire, and only after some hours
had<br>
 something or other set the imprisoned motive power free.</p>

<p>But what about the screeching? Could there be some living
creature<br>
 concealed within the box? Was I listening to the cries of
some<br>
 small animal in agony? Momentary reflection suggested that
the<br>
 explanation of the one thing was the explanation of the
other.<br>
 Rust!--there was the mystery. The same rust which had
prevented<br>
 the mechanism from acting at once was causing the screeching
now.<br>
 The uncanny sounds were caused by nothing more nor less than
the<br>
 want of a drop or two of oil. Such an explanation would not
have<br>
 satisfied Pugh, it satisfied me.</p>

<p>Picking up the box, I placed it to my ear.</p>

<p>"I wonder how long this little performance is going to
continue.<br>
 And what is going to happen when it is good enough to cease?
I<br>
 hope"--an uncomfortable thought occurred to me--"I hope Pugh
hasn't<br>
 picked up some pleasant little novelty in the way of an
infernal<br>
 machine. It would be a first-rate joke if he and I had been<br>
 endeavoring to solve the puzzle of how to set it going."</p>

<p>I don't mind owning that as this reflection crossed my mind
I<br>
 replaced Pugh's puzzle on the dressing-table. The idea did
not<br>
 commend itself to me at all. The box evidently contained
some<br>
 curious mechanism. It might be more curious than
comfortable.<br>
 Possibly some agreeable little device in clockwork. The
tick,<br>
 tick, tick suggested clockwork which had been planned to go
a<br>
 certain time, and then--then, for all I knew, ignite an
explosive,<br>
 and--blow up. It would be a charming solution to the puzzle if
it<br>
 were to explode while I stood there, in my nightshirt, looking
on.<br>
 It is true that the box weighed very little. Probably, as I
have<br>
 said, the whole affair would not have turned the scale at a
couple<br>
 of ounces. But then its very lightness might have been part of
the<br>
 ingenious inventor's little game. There are explosives with
which<br>
 one can work a very satisfactory amount of damage with
considerably<br>
 less than a couple of ounces.</p>

<p>While I was hesitating--I own it!--whether I had not better
immerse<br>
 Pugh's puzzle in a can of water, or throw it out of the window,
or<br>
 call down Bob with a request to at once remove it to his
apartment,<br>
 both the tick, tick, tick, and the screeching ceased, and
all<br>
 within the box was still. If it WAS going to explode, it was
now<br>
 or never. Instinctively I moved in the direction of the
door.</p>

<p>I waited with a certain sense of anxiety. I waited in
vain.<br>
 Nothing happened, not even a renewal of the sound.</p>

<p>"I wish Pugh had kept his precious puzzle at home. This sort
of<br>
 thing tries one's nerves."</p>

<p>When I thought that I perceived that nothing seemed likely
to<br>
 happen, I returned to the neighborhood of the table. I looked
at<br>
 the box askance. I took it up gingerly. Something might go off
at<br>
 any moment for all I knew. It would be too much of a joke if<br>
 Pugh's precious puzzle exploded in my hand. I shook it
doubtfully;<br>
 nothing rattled. I held it to my ear. There was not a sound.<br>
 What had taken place? Had the clockwork run down, and was
the<br>
 machine arranged with such a diabolical ingenuity that a
certain<br>
 interval was required, after the clockwork had run down, before
an<br>
 explosion could occur? Or had rust caused the mechanism to
again<br>
 hang fire?</p>

<p>"After making all that commotion the thing might at least
come<br>
 open." I banged the box viciously against the corner of the
table.<br>
 I felt that I would almost rather that an explosion should
take<br>
 place than that nothing should occur. One does not care to
be<br>
 disturbed from one's sound slumber in the small hours of the<br>
 morning for a trifle.</p>

<p>"I've half a mind to get a hammer, and try, as they say in
the<br>
 cookery books, another way."</p>

<p>Unfortunately I had promised Pugh to abstain from using force.
I<br>
 might have shivered the box open with my hammer, and then
explained<br>
 that it had fallen, or got trod upon, or sat upon, or
something,<br>
 and so got shattered, only I was afraid that Pugh would not
believe<br>
 me. The man is himself such an untruthful man that he is in
a<br>
 chronic state of suspicion about the truthfulness of others.</p>

<p>"Well, if you're not going to blow up, or open, or something,
I'll<br>
 say good night."</p>

<p>I gave the box a final rap with my knuckles and a final
shake,<br>
 replaced it on the table, put out the gas, and returned to
bed.</p>

<p>I was just sinking again into slumber, when that box began
again.<br>
 It was true that Pugh had purchased the puzzle, but it was
evident<br>
 that the whole enjoyment of the purchase was destined to be
mine.<br>
 It was useless to think of sleep while that performance was
going<br>
 on. I sat up in bed once more.</p>

<p>"It strikes me that the puzzle consists in finding out how it
is<br>
 possible to go to sleep with Pugh's purchase in your bedroom.
This<br>
 is far better than the old-fashioned prescription of cats on
the<br>
 tiles."</p>

<p>It struck me the noise was distinctly louder than before;
this<br>
 applied both to the tick, tick, tick, and the screeching.</p>

<p>"Possibly," I told myself, as I relighted the gas, "the
explosion<br>
 is to come off this time."</p>

<p>I turned to look at the box. There could be no doubt about it;
the<br>
 noise was louder. And, if I could trust my eyes, the box was<br>
 moving--giving a series of little jumps. This might have been
an<br>
 optical delusion, but it seemed to me that at each tick the
box<br>
 gave a little bound. During the screeches--which sounded more
like<br>
 the cries of an animal in an agony of pain even than before--if
it<br>
 did not tilt itself first on one end, and then on another, I
shall<br>
 never be willing to trust the evidence of my own eyes again.
And<br>
 surely the box had increased in size; I could have sworn not
only<br>
 that it had increased, but that it was increasing, even as I
stood<br>
 there looking on. It had grown, and still was growing, both<br>
 broader, and longer, and deeper. Pugh, of course, would have<br>
 attributed it to supernatural agency; there never was a man
with<br>
 such a nose for a ghost. I could picture him occupying my<br>
 position, shivering in his nightshirt, as he beheld that
miracle<br>
 taking place before his eyes. The solution which at once
suggested<br>
 itself to me--and which would NEVER have suggested itself to
Pugh!--<br>
 was that the box was fashioned, as it were, in layers, and
that<br>
 the ingenious mechanism it contained was forcing the sides at
once<br>
 both upward and outward. I took it in my hand. I could feel<br>
 something striking against the bottom of the box, like the
tap,<br>
 tap, tapping of a tiny hammer.</p>

<p>"This is a pretty puzzle of Pugh's. He would say that that is
the<br>
 tapping of a deathwatch. For my part I have not much faith
in<br>
 deathwatches, et hoc genus omne, but it certainly is a
curious<br>
 tapping; I wonder what is going to happen next?"</p>

<p>Apparently nothing, except a continuation of those
mysterious<br>
 sounds. That the box had increased in size I had, and have,
no<br>
 doubt whatever. I should say that it had increased a good inch
in<br>
 every direction, at least half an inch while I had been looking
on.<br>
 But while I stood looking its growth was suddenly and
perceptibly<br>
 stayed; it ceased to move. Only the noise continued.</p>

<p>"I wonder how long it will be before anything worth happening
does<br>
 happen! I suppose something is going to happen; there can't be
all<br>
 this to-do for nothing. If it is anything in the infernal
machine<br>
 line, and there is going to be an explosion, I might as well
be<br>
 here to see it. I think I'll have a pipe."</p>

<p>I put on my dressing-gown. I lit my pipe. I sat and stared at
the<br>
 box. I dare say I sat there for quite twenty minutes when,
as<br>
 before, without any sort of warning, the sound was stilled.
Its<br>
 sudden cessation rather startled me.</p>

<p>"Has the mechanism again hung fire? Or, this time, is the<br>
 explosion coming off?" It did not come off; nothing came
off.<br>
 "Isn't the box even going to open?"</p>

<p>It did not open. There was simply silence all at once, and
that<br>
 was all. I sat there in expectation for some moments longer.
But<br>
 I sat for nothing. I rose. I took the box in my hand. I
shook<br>
 it.</p>

<p>"This puzzle IS a puzzle." I held the box first to one ear,
then<br>
 to the other. I gave it several sharp raps with my knuckles.<br>
 There was not an answering sound, not even the sort of<br>
 reverberation which Pugh and I had noticed at first. It
seemed<br>
 hollower than ever. It was as though the soul of the box was
dead.<br>
 "I suppose if I put you down, and extinguish the gas and return
to<br>
 bed, in about half an hour or so, just as I am dropping off
to<br>
 sleep, the performance will be recommenced. Perhaps the third
time<br>
 will be lucky."</p>

<p>But I was mistaken--there was no third time. When I returned
to<br>
 bed that time I returned to sleep, and I was allowed to
sleep;<br>
 there was no continuation of the performance, at least so far as
I<br>
 know. For no sooner was I once more between the sheets than I
was<br>
 seized with an irresistible drowsiness, a drowsiness which
so<br>
 mastered me that I--I imagine it must have been
instantly--sank<br>
 into slumber which lasted till long after day had dawned.
Whether<br>
 or not any more mysterious sounds issued from the bowels of
Pugh's<br>
 puzzle is more than I can tell. If they did, they did not
succeed<br>
 in rousing me.</p>

<p>And yet, when at last I did awake, I had a sort of
consciousness<br>
 that my waking had been caused by something strange. What it was
I<br>
 could not surmise. My own impression was that I had been
awakened<br>
 by the touch of a person's hand. But that impression must
have<br>
 been a mistaken one, because, as I could easily see by
looking<br>
 round the room, there was no one in the room to touch me.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight. I looked at my watch; it was nearly
eleven<br>
 o'clock. I am a pretty late sleeper as a rule, but I do not<br>
 usually sleep as late as that. That scoundrel Bob would let
me<br>
 sleep all day without thinking it necessary to call me. I was
just<br>
 about to spring out of bed with the intention of ringing the
bell<br>
 so that I might give Bob a piece of my mind for allowing me
to<br>
 sleep so late, when my glance fell on the dressing-table on
which,<br>
 the night before, I had placed Pugh's puzzle. It had gone!</p>

<p>Its absence so took me by surprise that I ran to the table. It
HAD<br>
 gone. But it had not gone far; it had gone to pieces! There
were<br>
 the pieces lying where the box had been. The puzzle had
solved<br>
 itself. The box was open, open with a vengeance, one might
say.<br>
 Like that unfortunate Humpty Dumpty, who, so the chroniclers
tell<br>
 us, sat on a wall, surely "all the king's horses and all the
king's<br>
 men" never could put Pugh's puzzle together again!</p>

<p>The marquetry had resolved itself into its component parts.
How<br>
 those parts had ever been joined was a mystery. They had been
laid<br>
 upon no foundation, as is the case with ordinary inlaid work.
The<br>
 several pieces of wood were not only of different shapes and
sizes,<br>
 but they were as thin as the thinnest veneer; yet the box had
been<br>
 formed by simply joining them together. The man who made that
box<br>
 must have been possessed of ingenuity worthy of a better
cause.</p>

<p>I perceived how the puzzle had been worked. The box had
contained<br>
 an arrangement of springs, which, on being released, had
expanded<br>
 themselves in different directions until their mere expansion
had<br>
 rent the box to pieces. There were the springs, lying amid
the<br>
 ruin they had caused.</p>

<p>There was something else amid that ruin besides those
springs;<br>
 there was a small piece of writing paper. I took it up. On
the<br>
 reverse side of it was written in a minute, crabbed hand: "A<br>
 Present For You." What was a present for me? I looked, and,
not<br>
 for the first time since I had caught sight of Pugh's
precious<br>
 puzzle, could scarcely believe my eyes.</p>

<p>There, poised between two upright wires, the bent ends of
which<br>
 held it aloft in the air, was either a piece of glass or--a<br>
 crystal. The scrap of writing paper had exactly covered it.
I<br>
 understood what it was, when Pugh and I had tapped with the
hammer,<br>
 had caused the answering taps to proceed from within. Our
taps<br>
 caused the wires to oscillate, and in these oscillations the<br>
 crystal, which they held suspended, had touched the side of
the<br>
 box.</p>

<p>I looked again at the piece of paper. "A Present For You."
Was<br>
 THIS the present--this crystal? I regarded it intently.</p>

<p>"It CAN'T be a diamond."</p>

<p>The idea was ridiculous, absurd. No man in his senses would
place<br>
 a diamond inside a twopenny-halfpenny puzzle box. The thing was
as<br>
 big as a walnut! And yet--I am a pretty good judge of
precious<br>
 stones--if it was not an uncut diamond it was the best imitation
I<br>
 had seen. I took it up. I examined it closely. The more
closely<br>
 I examined it, the more my wonder grew.</p>

<p>"It IS a diamond!"</p>

<p>And yet the idea was too preposterous for credence. Who
would<br>
 present a diamond as big as a walnut with a trumpery puzzle?<br>
 Besides, all the diamonds which the world contains of that size
are<br>
 almost as well known as the Koh-i-noor.</p>

<p>"If it is a diamond, it is worth--it is worth--Heaven only
knows<br>
 what it isn't worth if it's a diamond."</p>

<p>I regarded it through a strong pocket lens. As I did so I
could<br>
 not restrain an exclamation.</p>

<p>"The world to a China orange, it IS a diamond!"</p>

<p>The words had scarcely escaped my lips than there came a
tapping at<br>
 the door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" I cried, supposing it was Bob. It was not Bob, it
was<br>
 Pugh. Instinctively I put the lens and the crystal behind my
back.<br>
 At sight of me in my nightshirt Pugh began to shake his
head.</p>

<p>"What hours, Tress, what hours! Why, my dear Tress, I've<br>
 breakfasted, read the papers and my letters, came all the way
from<br>
 my house here, and you're not up!"</p>

<p>"Don't I look as though I were up?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Tress! Tress!" He approached the dressing-table. His
eye<br>
 fell upon the ruins. "What's this?"</p>

<p>"That's the solution to the puzzle."</p>

<p>"Have you--have you solved it fairly, Tress?"</p>

<p>"It has solved itself. Our handling, and tapping, and
hammering<br>
 must have freed the springs which the box contained, and during
the<br>
 night, while I slept, they have caused it to come open."</p>

<p>"While you slept? Dear me! How strange! And--what are
these?"</p>

<p>He had discovered the two upright wires on which the crystal
had<br>
 been poised.</p>

<p>"I suppose they're part of the puzzle."</p>

<p>"And was there anything in the box? What's this?" he picked up
the<br>
 scrap of paper; I had left it on the table. He read what was<br>
 written on it: "'A Present For You.' What's it mean? Tress,
was<br>
 this in the box?"</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>"What's it mean about a present? Was there anything in the
box<br>
 besides?"</p>

<p>"Pugh, if you will leave the room I shall be able to dress; I
am<br>
 not in the habit of receiving quite such early calls, or I
should<br>
 have been prepared to receive you. If you will wait in the
next<br>
 room, I will be with you as soon as I'm dressed. There is a
little<br>
 subject in connection with the box which I wish to discuss
with<br>
 you."</p>

<p>"A subject in connection with the box? What is the
subject?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, Pugh, when I have performed my toilet."</p>

<p>"Why can't you tell me now?"</p>

<p>"Do you propose, then, that I should stand here shivering in
my<br>
 shirt while you are prosing at your ease? Thank you; I am
obliged,<br>
 but I decline. May I ask you once more, Pugh, to wait for me
in<br>
 the adjoining apartment?"</p>

<p>He moved toward the door. When he had taken a couple of steps,
he<br>
 halted.</p>

<p>"I--I hope, Tress, that you're--you're going to play no tricks
on<br>
 me?"</p>

<p>"Tricks on you! Is it likely that I am going to play tricks
upon<br>
 my oldest friend?"</p>

<p>When he had gone--he vanished, it seemed to me, with a
somewhat<br>
 doubtful visage--I took the crystal to the window. I drew
the<br>
 blind. I let the sunshine fall on it. I examined it again,<br>
 closely and minutely, with the aid of my pocket lens. It WAS
a<br>
 diamond; there could not be a doubt of it. If, with my
knowledge<br>
 of stones, I was deceived, then I was deceived as never man
had<br>
 been deceived before. My heart beat faster as I recognized
the<br>
 fact that I was holding in my hand what was, in all probability,
a<br>
 fortune for a man of moderate desires. Of course, Pugh knew<br>
 nothing of what I had discovered, and there was no reason why
he<br>
 should know. Not the least! The only difficulty was that if
I<br>
 kept my own counsel, and sold the stone and utilized the
proceeds<br>
 of the sale, I should have to invent a story which would
account<br>
 for my sudden accession to fortune. Pugh knows almost as much
of<br>
 my affairs as I do myself. That is the worst of these old
friends!</p>

<p><br>
 When I joined Pugh I found him dancing up and down the floor
like a<br>
 bear upon hot plates. He scarcely allowed me to put my nose
inside<br>
 the door before attacking me.</p>

<p>"Tress, give me what was in the box."</p>

<p>"My dear Pugh, how do you know that there was something in the
box<br>
 to give you?"</p>

<p>"I know there was!"</p>

<p>"Indeed! If you know that there was something in the box,
perhaps<br>
 you will tell me what that something was."</p>

<p>He eyed me doubtfully. Then, advancing, he laid upon my arm a
hand<br>
 which positively trembled.</p>

<p>"Tress, you--you wouldn't play tricks on an old friend."</p>

<p>"You are right, Pugh, I wouldn't, though I believe there have
been<br>
 occasions on which you have had doubts upon the subject. By
the<br>
 way, Pugh, I believe that I am the oldest friend you have."</p>

<p>"I--I don't know about that. There's--there's Brasher."</p>

<p>"Brasher! Who's Brasher? You wouldn't compare my friendship
to<br>
 the friendship of such a man as Brasher? Think of the tastes
we<br>
 have in common, you and I. We're both collectors."</p>

<p>"Ye-es, we're both collectors."</p>

<p>"I make my interests yours, and you make your interests
mine.<br>
 Isn't that so, Pugh?"</p>

<p>"Tress, what--what was in the box?"</p>

<p>"I will be frank with you, Pugh. If there had been something
in<br>
 the box, would you have been willing to go halves with me in
my<br>
 discovery?"</p>

<p>"Go halves! In your discovery, Tress! Give me what is
mine!"</p>

<p>"With pleasure, Pugh, if you will tell me what is yours."</p>

<p>"If--if you don't give me what was in the box I'll--I'll send
for<br>
 the police."</p>

<p>"Do! Then I shall be able to hand to them what was in the box
in<br>
 order that it may be restored to its proper owner."</p>

<p>"Its proper owner! I'm its proper owner!"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but I don't understand how that can be; at least,
until<br>
 the police have made inquiries. I should say that the proper
owner<br>
 was the person from whom you purchased the box, or, more
probably,<br>
 the person from whom he purchased it, and by whom, doubtless,
it<br>
 was sold in ignorance, or by mistake. Thus, Pugh, if you will
only<br>
 send for the police, we shall earn the gratitude of a person
of<br>
 whom we never heard in our lives--I for discovering the contents
of<br>
 the box, and you for returning them."</p>

<p>As I said this, Pugh's face was a study. He gasped for breath.
He<br>
 actually took out his handkerchief to wipe his brow.</p>

<p>"Tress, I--I don't think you need to use a tone like that to
me.<br>
 It isn't friendly. What--what was in the box?"</p>

<p>"Let us understand each other, Pugh. If you don't hand over
what<br>
 was in the box to the police, I go halves."</p>

<p>Pugh began to dance about the floor.</p>

<p>"What a fool I was to trust you with the box! I knew I
couldn't<br>
 trust you." I said nothing. I turned and rang the bell.
"What's<br>
 that for?"</p>

<p>"That, my dear Pugh, is for breakfast, and, if you desire it,
for<br>
 the police. You know, although you have breakfasted, I
haven't.<br>
 Perhaps while I am breaking my fast, you would like to summon
the<br>
 representatives of law and order." Bob came in. I ordered<br>
 breakfast. Then I turned to Pugh. "Is there anything you
would<br>
 like?"</p>

<p>"No, I--I've breakfasted."</p>

<p>"It wasn't of breakfast I was thinking. It was of--something
else.<br>
 Bob is at your service, if, for instance, you wish to send him
on<br>
 an errand."</p>

<p>"No, I want nothing. Bob can go." Bob went. Directly he
was<br>
 gone, Pugh turned to me. "You shall have half. What was in
the<br>
 box?"</p>

<p>"I shall have half?"</p>

<p>"You shall!"</p>

<p>"I don't think it is necessary that the terms of our
little<br>
 understanding should be expressly embodied in black and white.
I<br>
 fancy that, under the circumstance, I can trust you, Pugh. I<br>
 believe that I am capable of seeing that, in this matter, you
don't<br>
 do me. That was in the box."</p>

<p>I held out the crystal between my finger and thumb.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That is what I desire to learn."</p>

<p>"Let me look at it."</p>

<p>"You are welcome to look at it where it is. Look at it as long
as<br>
 you like, and as closely."</p>

<p>Pugh leaned over my hand. His eyes began to gleam. He is
himself<br>
 not a bad judge of precious stones, is Pugh.</p>

<p>"It's--it's--Tress!--is it a diamond?"</p>

<p>"That question I have already asked myself."</p>

<p>"Let me look at it! It will be safe with me! It's mine!"</p>

<p>I immediately put the thing behind my back.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, it belongs neither to you nor to me. It belongs,
in<br>
 all probability, to the person who sold that puzzle to the man
from<br>
 whom you bought it--perhaps some weeping widow, Pugh, or
hopeless<br>
 orphan--think of it. Let us have no further misunderstanding
upon<br>
 that point, my dear old friend. Still, because you are my dear
old<br>
 friend, I am willing to trust you with this discovery of mine,
on<br>
 condition that you don't attempt to remove it from my sight,
and<br>
 that you return it to me the moment I require you."</p>

<p>"You're--you're very hard on me." I made a movement toward
my<br>
 waistcoat pocket. "I'll return it to you!"</p>

<p>I handed him the crystal, and with it I handed him my pocket
lens.</p>

<p>"With the aid of that glass I imagine that you will be able
to<br>
 subject it to a more acute examination, Pugh."</p>

<p>He began to examine it through the lens. Directly he did so,
he<br>
 gave an exclamation. In a few moments he looked up at me.
His<br>
 eyes were glistening behind his spectacles. I could see he<br>
 trembled.</p>

<p>"Tress, it's--it's a diamond, a Brazil diamond. It's worth
a<br>
 fortune!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so."</p>

<p>"Glad I think so! Don't you think that it's a diamond?"</p>

<p>"It appears to be a diamond. Under ordinary conditions I
should<br>
 say, without hesitation, that it was a diamond. But when I<br>
 consider the circumstances of its discovery, I am driven to
doubts.<br>
 How much did you give for that puzzle, Pugh?"</p>

<p>"Ninepence; the fellow wanted a shilling, but I gave him
ninepence.<br>
 He seemed content."</p>

<p>"Ninepence! Does it seem reasonable that we should find a
diamond,<br>
 which, if it is a diamond, is the finest stone I ever saw
and<br>
 handled, in a ninepenny puzzle? It is not as though it had
got<br>
 into the thing by accident, it had evidently been placed there
to<br>
 be found, and, apparently, by anyone who chanced to solve
the<br>
 puzzle; witness the writing on the scrap of paper."</p>

<p>Pugh re-examined the crystal.</p>

<p>"It is a diamond! I'll stake my life that it's a diamond!"</p>

<p>"Still, though it be a diamond, I smell a rat!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I strongly suspect that the person who placed that diamond
inside<br>
 that puzzle intended to have a joke at the expense of the
person<br>
 who discovered it. What was to be the nature of the joke is
more<br>
 than I can say at present, but I should like to have a bet with
you<br>
 that the man who compounded that puzzle was an ingenious
practical<br>
 joker. I may be wrong, Pugh; we shall see. But, until I have<br>
 proved the contrary, I don't believe that the maddest man that
ever<br>
 lived would throw away a diamond worth, apparently, shall we say
a<br>
 thousand pounds?"</p>

<p>"A thousand pounds! This diamond is worth a good deal more
than a<br>
 thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Well, that only makes my case the stronger; I don't believe
that<br>
 the maddest man that ever lived would throw away a diamond
worth<br>
 more than a thousand pounds with such utter wantonness as seems
to<br>
 have characterized the action of the original owner of the
stone<br>
 which I found in your ninepenny puzzle, Pugh."</p>

<p>"There have been some eccentric characters in the world, some
very<br>
 eccentric characters. However, as you say, we shall see. I
fancy<br>
 that I know somebody who would be quite willing to have such
a<br>
 diamond as this, and who, moreover, would be willing to pay a
fair<br>
 price for its possession; I will take it to him and see what
he<br>
 says."</p>

<p>"Pugh, hand me back that diamond."</p>

<p>"My dear Tress, I was only going--"</p>

<p>Bob came in with the breakfast tray.</p>

<p>"Pugh, you will either hand me that at once, or Bob shall
summon<br>
 the representatives of law and order."</p>

<p>He handed me the diamond. I sat down to breakfast with a
hearty<br>
 appetite. Pugh stood and scowled at me.</p>

<p>"Joseph Tress, it is my solemn conviction, and I have no
hesitation<br>
 in saying so in plain English, that you're a thief."</p>

<p>"My dear Pugh, it seems to me that we show every promise
of<br>
 becoming a couple of thieves."</p>

<p>"Don't bracket me with you!"</p>

<p>"Not at all, you are worse than I. It is you who decline to
return<br>
 the contents of the box to its proper owner. Put it to
yourself,<br>
 you have SOME common sense, my dear old friend I--do you
suppose<br>
 that a diamond worth more than a thousand pounds is to be
HONESTLY<br>
 bought for ninepence?"</p>

<p>He resumed his old trick of dancing about the room.</p>

<p>"I was a fool ever to let you have the box! I ought to have
known<br>
 better than to have trusted you; goodness knows you have given
me<br>
 sufficient cause to mistrust you! Over and over again! Your<br>
 character is only too notorious! You have plundered friend and
foe<br>
 alike--friend and foe alike! As for the rubbish which you
call<br>
 your collection, nine tenths of it, I know as a positive fact,
you<br>
 have stolen out and out."</p>

<p>"Who stole my Sir Walter Raleigh pipe? Wasn't it a man
named<br>
 Pugh?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Joseph Tress!"</p>

<p>"I'm looking."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's no good talking to you, not the least!
You're--you're<br>
 dead to all the promptings of conscience! May I inquire, Mr.<br>
 Tress, what it is you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"I PROPOSE to do nothing, except summon the representatives of
law<br>
 and order. Failing that, my dear Pugh, I had some faint,
vague,<br>
 very vague idea of taking the contents of your ninepenny puzzle
to<br>
 a certain firm in Hatton Garden, who are dealers in precious<br>
 stones, and to learn from them if they are disposed to give<br>
 anything for it, and if so, what."</p>

<p>"I shall come with you."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, on condition that you pay the cab."</p>

<p>"I pay the cab! I will pay half."</p>

<p>"Not at all. You will either pay the whole fare, or else I
will<br>
 have one cab and you shall have another. It is a
three-shilling<br>
 cab fare from here to Hatton Garden. If you propose to share
my<br>
 cab, you will be so good as to hand over that three
shillings<br>
 before we start."</p>

<p>He gasped, but he handed over the three shillings. There are
few<br>
 things I enjoy so much as getting money out of Pugh!</p>

<p>On the road to Hatton Garden we wrangled nearly all the way. I
own<br>
 that I feel a certain satisfaction in irritating Pugh, he is
such<br>
 an irritable man. He wanted to know what I thought we should
get<br>
 for the diamond.</p>

<p>"You can't expect to get much for the contents of a
ninepenny<br>
 puzzle, not even the price of a cab fare, Pugh."</p>

<p>He eyed me, but for some minutes he was silent. Then he
began<br>
 again.</p>

<p>"Tress, I don't think we ought to let it go for less
than--than<br>
 five thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Seriously, Pugh, I doubt whether, when the whole affair is
ended,<br>
 we shall get five thousand pence for it, or, for the matter
of<br>
 that, five thousand farthings."</p>

<p>"But why not? Why not? It's a magnificent
stone--magnificent!<br>
 I'll stake my life on it."</p>

<p>I tapped my breast with the tips of my fingers.</p>

<p>"There's a warning voice within my breast that ought to be
in<br>
 yours, Pugh! Something tells me, perhaps it is the unusually<br>
 strong vein of common sense which I possess, that the contents
of<br>
 your ninepenny puzzle will be found to be a magnificent
do--an<br>
 ingenious practical joke, my friend."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>But I think he did; at any rate, I had unsettled the
foundations of<br>
 his faith.</p>

<p>We entered the Hatton Garden office side by side; in his
anxiety<br>
 not to let me get before him, Pugh actually clung to my arm.
The<br>
 office was divided into two parts by a counter which ran from
wall<br>
 to wall. I advanced to a man who stood on the other side of
this<br>
 counter.</p>

<p><br>
 "I want to sell you a diamond."</p>

<p>"WE want to sell you a diamond," interpolated Pugh.</p>

<p>I turned to Pugh. I "fixed" him with my glance.</p>

<p>"I want to sell you a diamond. Here it is. What will you give
me<br>
 for it?"</p>

<p>Taking the crystal from my waistcoat pocket I handed it to the
man<br>
 on the other side of the counter. Directly he got it between
his<br>
 fingers, and saw that it was that he had got, I noticed a
sudden<br>
 gleam come into his eyes.</p>

<p>"This is--this is rather a fine stone."</p>

<p>Pugh nudged my arm.</p>

<p>"I told you so." I paid no attention to Pugh. "What will you
give<br>
 me for it?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean, what will I give you for it cash down upon the
nail?"</p>

<p>"Just so--what will you give me for it cash down upon the
nail?"</p>

<p>The man turned the crystal over and over in his fingers.
"Well,<br>
 that's rather a large order. We don't often get a chance of
buying<br>
 such a stone as this across the counter. What do you say
to--well--<br>
 to ten thousand pounds?"</p>

<p>Ten thousand pounds! It was beyond my wildest imaginings.
Pugh<br>
 gasped. He lurched against the counter.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pounds!" he echoed.</p>

<p>The man on the other side glanced at him, I thought, a
little<br>
 curiously.</p>

<p>"If you can give me references, or satisfy me in any way as to
your<br>
 bona fides, I am prepared to give you for this diamond an
open<br>
 check for ten thousand pounds, or if you prefer it, the cash<br>
 instead."</p>

<p>I stared; I was not accustomed to see business transacted on
quite<br>
 such lines as those.</p>

<p>"We'll take it," murmured Pugh; I believe he was too much
overcome<br>
 by his feelings to do more than murmur. I interposed.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you will excuse my saying that you arrive
very<br>
 rapidly at your conclusions. In the first place, how can you
make<br>
 sure that it is a diamond?"</p>

<p>The man behind the counter smiled.</p>

<p>"I should be very ill-fitted for the position which I hold if
I<br>
 could not tell a diamond directly I get a sight of it,
especially<br>
 such a stone as this."</p>

<p>"But have you no tests you can apply?"</p>

<p>"We have tests which we apply in cases in which doubt exists,
but<br>
 in this case there is no doubt whatever. I am as sure that this
is<br>
 a diamond as I am sure that it is air I breathe. However, here
is<br>
 a test."</p>

<p>There was a wheel close by the speaker. It was worked by a<br>
 treadle. It was more like a superior sort of
traveling-tinker's<br>
 grindstone than anything else. The man behind the counter put
his<br>
 foot upon the treadle. The wheel began to revolve. He brought
the<br>
 crystal into contact with the swiftly revolving wheel. There was
a<br>
 s--s--sh! And, in an instant, his hand was empty; the crystal
had<br>
 vanished into air.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he gasped. I never saw such a look of
amazement on<br>
 a human countenance before. "It's splintered!"</p>

<h3><br>
 POSTSCRIPT</h3>

<p><br>
 It WAS a diamond, although it HAD splintered. In that fact lay
the<br>
 point of the joke. The man behind the counter had not been
wrong;<br>
 examination of such dust as could be collected proved that
fact<br>
 beyond a doubt. It was declared by experts that the diamond,
at<br>
 some period of its history, had been subjected to intense
and<br>
 continuing heat. The result had been to make it as brittle
as<br>
 glass.</p>

<p><br>
 There could be no doubt that its original owner had been an
expert<br>
 too. He knew where he got it from, and he probably knew what
it<br>
 had endured. He was aware that, from a mercantile point of
view,<br>
 it was worthless; it could never have been cut. So, having a
turn<br>
 for humor of a peculiar kind, he had devoted days, and weeks,
and<br>
 possibly months, to the construction of that puzzle. He had
placed<br>
 the diamond inside, and he had enjoyed, in anticipation and
in<br>
 imagination, the Alnaschar visions of the lucky finder.</p>

<p>Pugh blamed me for the catastrophe. He said, and still says,
that<br>
 if I had not, in a measure, and quite gratuitously, insisted on
a<br>
 test, the man behind the counter would have been satisfied with
the<br>
 evidence of his organs of vision, and we should have been richer
by<br>
 ten thousand pounds. But I satisfy my conscience with the<br>
 reflection that what I did at any rate was honest, though, at
the<br>
 same time, I am perfectly well aware that such a reflection
gives<br>
 Pugh no sort of satisfaction.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>The Great Valdez Sapphire</h2>

<p><br>
 I know more about it than anyone else in the world, its
present<br>
 owner not excepted. I can give its whole history, from the<br>
 Cingalese who found it, the Spanish adventurer who stole it,
the<br>
 cardinal who bought it, the Pope who graciously accepted it,
the<br>
 favored son of the Church who received it, the gay and giddy<br>
 duchess who pawned it, down to the eminent prelate who now holds
it<br>
 in trust as a family heirloom.</p>

<p><br>
 It will occupy a chapter to itself in my forthcoming work on<br>
 "Historic Stones," where full details of its weight, size,
color,<br>
 and value may be found. At present I am going to relate an<br>
 incident in its history which, for obvious reasons, will not
be<br>
 published--which, in fact, I trust the reader will consider
related<br>
 in strict confidence.</p>

<p>I had never seen the stone itself when I began to write about
it,<br>
 and it was not till one evening last spring, while staying with
my<br>
 nephew, Sir Thomas Acton, that I came within measurable distance
of<br>
 it. A dinner party was impending, and, at my instigation,
the<br>
 Bishop of Northchurch and Miss Panton, his daughter and
heiress,<br>
 were among the invited guests.</p>

<p>The dinner was a particularly good one, I remember that
distinctly.<br>
 In fact, I felt myself partly responsible for it, having
engaged<br>
 the new cook--a talented young Italian, pupil of the admirable
old<br>
 chef at my club. We had gone over the menu carefully
together,<br>
 with a result refreshing in its novelty, but not so daring as
to<br>
 disturb the minds of the innocent country guests who were
bidden<br>
 thereto.</p>

<p>The first spoonful of soup was reassuring, and I looked to the
end<br>
 of the table to exchange a congratulatory glance with Leta.
What<br>
 was amiss? No response. Her pretty face was flushed, her
smile<br>
 constrained, she was talking with quite unnecessary empressement
to<br>
 her neighbor, Sir Harry Landor, though Leta is one of those
few<br>
 women who understand the importance of letting a man settle
down<br>
 tranquilly and with an undisturbed mind to the business of
dining,<br>
 allowing no topic of serious interest to come on before the<br>
 releves, and reserving mere conversational brilliancy for
the<br>
 entremets.</p>

<p>Guests all right? No disappointments? I had gone through the
list<br>
 with her, selecting just the right people to be asked to meet
the<br>
 Landors, our new neighbors. Not a mere cumbrous county
gathering,<br>
 nor yet a showy imported party from town, but a skillful
blending<br>
 of both. Had anything happened already? I had been late for<br>
 dinner and missed the arrivals in the drawing-room. It was
Leta's<br>
 fault. She has got into a way of coming into my room and
putting<br>
 the last touches to my toilet. I let her, for I am doubtful
of<br>
 myself nowadays after many years' dependence on the best of
valets.<br>
 Her taste is generally beyond dispute, but to-day she had
indulged<br>
 in a feminine vagary that provoked me and made me late for
dinner.</p>

<p>"Are you going to wear your sapphire, Uncle Paul!" she cried
in a<br>
 tone of dismay. "Oh, why not the ruby?"</p>

<p>"You WOULD have your way about the table decorations," I
gently<br>
 reminded her. "with that service of Crown Derby repousse and<br>
 orchids, the ruby would look absolutely barbaric. Now if you
would<br>
 have had the Limoges set, white candles, and a yellow silk
center--"</p>

<p>"Oh, but--I'm SO disappointed--I wanted the bishop to see
your<br>
 ruby--or one of your engraved gems--"</p>

<p>"My dear, it is on the bishop's account I put this on. You
know<br>
 his daughter is heiress of the great Valdez sapphire--"</p>

<p>"Of course she is, and when he has the charge of a stone
three<br>
 times as big as yours, what's the use of wearing it? The
ruby,<br>
 dear Uncle Paul, PLEASE!"</p>

<p>She was desperately in earnest I could see, and considering
the<br>
 obligations which I am supposed to be under to her and Tom, it
was<br>
 but a little matter to yield, but it involved a good deal of
extra<br>
 trouble. Studs, sleeve-links, watch-guard, all carefully
selected<br>
 to go with the sapphire, had to be changed, the emerald which
I<br>
 chose as a compromise requiring more florid accompaniments of
a<br>
 deeper tone of gold; and the dinner hour struck as I replaced
my<br>
 jewel case, the one relic left me of a once handsome fortune, in
my<br>
 fireproof safe.</p>

<p>The emerald looked very well that evening, however. I kept my
eyes<br>
 upon it for comfort when Miss Panton proved trying.</p>

<p>She was a lean, yellow, dictatorial young person with no<br>
 conversation. I spoke of her father's celebrated sapphires.
"MY<br>
 sapphires," she amended sourly; "though I am legally debarred
from<br>
 making any profitable use of them." She furthermore informed
me<br>
 that she viewed them as useless gauds, which ought to be
disposed<br>
 of for the benefit of the heathen. I gave the subject up,
and<br>
 while she discoursed of the work of the Blue Ribbon Army among
the<br>
 Bosjesmans I tried to understand a certain dislocation in
the<br>
 arrangement of the table. Surely we were more or less in
number<br>
 than we should be? Opposite side all right. Who was extra on<br>
 ours? I leaned forward. Lady Landor on one side of Tom, on
the<br>
 other who? I caught glimpses of plumes pink and green nodding
over<br>
 a dinner plate, and beneath them a pink nose in a green visage
with<br>
 a nutcracker chin altogether unknown to me. A sharp gray eye
shot<br>
 a sideway glance down the table and caught me peeping, and I<br>
 retreated, having only marked in addition two clawlike hands,
with<br>
 pointed ruffles and a mass of brilliant rings, making good
play<br>
 with a knife and fork. Who was she? At intervals a high acid<br>
 voice could be heard addressing Tom, and a laugh that made
me<br>
 shudder; it had the quality of the scream of a bird of prey or
the<br>
 yell of a jackal. I had heard that sort of laugh before, and
it<br>
 always made me feel like a defenseless rabbit.</p>

<p>Every time it sounded I saw Leta's fan flutter more furiously
and<br>
 her manner grow more nervously animated. Poor dear girl! I
never<br>
 in all my recollection wished a dinner at an end so earnestly so
as<br>
 to assure her of my support and sympathy, though without the<br>
 faintest conception why either should be required.</p>

<p>The ices at last. A menu card folded in two was laid beside
me. I<br>
 read it unobserved. "Keep the B. from joining us in the
drawing-<br>
 room." The B.? The bishop, of course. With pleasure. But
why?<br>
 And how? THAT'S the question, never mind "why." Could I lure
him<br>
 into the library--the billiard room--the conservatory? I
doubted<br>
 it, and I doubted still more what I should do with him when I
got<br>
 him there.</p>

<p>The bishop is a grand and stately ecclesiastic of the
mediaeval<br>
 type, broad-chested, deep-voiced, martial of bearing. I
could<br>
 picture him charging mace in hand at the head of his vassals,
or<br>
 delivering over a dissenter of the period to the rack and<br>
 thumbscrew, but not pottering among rare editions, tall copies
and<br>
 Grolier bindings, nor condescending to a quiet cigar among the
tree<br>
 ferns and orchids. Leta must and should be obeyed, I swore,<br>
 nevertheless, even if I were driven to lock the door in the<br>
 fearless old fashion of a bygone day, and declare I'd shoot any
man<br>
 who left while a drop remained in the bottles.</p>

<p>The ladies were rising. The lady at the head of the line
smirked<br>
 and nodded her pink plumes coquettishly at Tom, while her
hawk's<br>
 eyes roved keen and predatory over us all. She stopped
suddenly,<br>
 creating a block and confusion.</p>

<p>"Ah, the dear bishop! YOU there, and I never saw you! You
must<br>
 come and have a nice long chat presently. By-by--!" She shook
her<br>
 fan at him over my shoulder and tripped off. Leta, passing
me<br>
 last, gave me a look of profound despair.</p>

<p>"Lady Carwitchet!" somebody exclaimed. "I couldn't believe
my<br>
 eyes."</p>

<p>"Thought she was dead or in penal servitude. Never should
have<br>
 expected to see her HERE," said some one else behind me<br>
 confidentially.</p>

<p>"What Carwitchet? Not the mother of the Carwitchet who--"</p>

<p>"Just so. The Carwitchet who---" Tom assented with a shrug.
"We<br>
 needn't go farther, as she's my guest. Just my luck. I met
them<br>
 at Buxton, thought them uncommonly good company--in fact,<br>
 Carwitchet laid me under a great obligation about a horse I
was<br>
 nearly let in for buying--and gave them a general invitation
here,<br>
 as one does, you know. Never expected her to turn up with
her<br>
 luggage this afternoon just before dinner, to stay a week, or
a<br>
 fortnight if Carwitchet can join her." A groan of sympathy
ran<br>
 round the table. "It can't be helped. I've told you this just
to<br>
 show that I shouldn't have asked you here to meet this sort
of<br>
 people of my own free will; but, as it is, please say no more
about<br>
 them." The subject was not dropped by any means, and I took
care<br>
 that it should not be. At our end of the table one story
after<br>
 another went buzzing round--sotto voce, out of deference to
Tom--<br>
 but perfectly audible.</p>

<p>"Carwitchet? Ah, yes. Mixed up in that Rawlings divorce
case,<br>
 wasn't he? A bad lot. Turned out of the Dragoon Guards for<br>
 cheating at cards, or picking pockets, or something--remember
the<br>
 row at the Cerulean Club? Scandalous exposure--and that
forged<br>
 letter business--oh, that was the mother--prosecution hushed
up<br>
 somehow. Ought to be serving her fourteen years--and that
business<br>
 of poor Farrars, the banker--got hold of some of his secrets
and<br>
 blackmailed him till he blew his brains out--"</p>

<p>It was so exciting that I clean forgot the bishop, till a low
gasp<br>
 at my elbow startled me. He was lying back in his chair, his<br>
 mighty shaven jowl a ghastly white, his fierce imperious
eyebrows<br>
 drooping limp over his fishlike eyes, his splendid figure
shrunk<br>
 and contracted. He was trying with a shaken hand to pour out
wine.<br>
 The decanter clattered against the glass and the wine spilled
on<br>
 the cloth.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you find the room too warm. Shall we go into
the<br>
 library?"</p>

<p>He rose hastily and followed me like a lamb.</p>

<p>He recovered himself once we got into the hall, and
affably<br>
 rejected all my proffers of brandy and soda--medical
advice--<br>
 everything else my limited experience could suggest. He only<br>
 demanded his carriage "directly" and that Miss Panton should
be<br>
 summoned forthwith.</p>

<p>I made the best use I could of the time left me.</p>

<p>"I'm uncommonly sorry you do not feel equal to staying a
little<br>
 longer, my lord. I counted on showing you my few trifles of<br>
 precious stones, the salvage from the wreck of my
possessions.<br>
 Nothing in comparison with your own collection."</p>

<p>The bishop clasped his hand over his heart. His breath came
short<br>
 and quick.</p>

<p>"A return of that dizziness," he explained with a faint
smile.<br>
 "You are thinking of the Valdez sapphire, are you not? Some
day,"<br>
 he went on with forced composure, "I may have the pleasure
of<br>
 showing it to you. It is at my banker's just now."</p>

<p>Miss Panton's steps were heard in the ball. "You are well
known as<br>
 a connoisseur, Mr. Acton," he went on hurriedly. "Is your<br>
 collection valuable? If so, keep it safe; don't trust a ring
off<br>
 your hand, or the key of your jewel case out of your pocket
till<br>
 the house is clear again." The words rushed from his lips in
an<br>
 impetuous whisper, he gave me a meaning glance, and departed
with<br>
 his daughter. I went back to the drawing-room, my head
swimming<br>
 with bewilderment.</p>

<p>"What! The dear bishop gone!" screamed Lady Carwitchet from
the<br>
 central ottoman where she sat, surrounded by most of the
gentlemen,<br>
 all apparently well entertained by her conversation. "And I
wanted<br>
 to talk over old times with him so badly. His poor wife was
my<br>
 greatest friend. Mira Montanaro, daughter of the great banker,
you<br>
 know. It's not possible that that miserable little prig is my
poor<br>
 Mira's girl. The heiress of all the Montanaros in a black
lace<br>
 gown worth twopence! When I think of her mother's beauty and
her<br>
 toilets! Does she ever wear the sapphires? Has anyone ever
seen<br>
 her in them? Eleven large stones in a lovely antique setting,
and<br>
 the great Valdez sapphire--worth thousands and thousands--for
the<br>
 pendant." No one replied. "I wanted to get a rise out of the<br>
 bishop to-night. It used to make him so mad when I wore
this."</p>

<p>She fumbled among the laces at her throat, and clawed out a
pendant<br>
 that hung to a velvet band around her neck. I fairly gasped
when<br>
 she removed her hand. A sapphire of irregular shape flashed
out<br>
 its blue lightning on us. Such a stone! A true, rich,
cornflower<br>
 blue even by that wretched artificial light, with soft
velvety<br>
 depths of color and dazzling clearness of tint in its lights
and<br>
 shades--a stone to remember! I stretched out my hand<br>
 involuntarily, but Lady Carwitchet drew back with a
coquettish<br>
 squeal. "No! no! You mustn't look any closer. Tell me what
you<br>
 think of it now. Isn't it pretty?"</p>

<p>"Superb!" was all I could ejaculate, staring at the azure
splendor<br>
 of that miraculous jewel in a sort of trance.</p>

<p>She gave a shrill cackling laugh of mockery.</p>

<p>"The great Mr. Acton taken in by a bit of Palais Royal
gimcrackery!<br>
 What an advertisement for Bogaerts et Cie! They are perfect<br>
 artists in frauds. Don't you remember their stand at the
first<br>
 Paris Exhibition? They had imitations there of every
celebrated<br>
 stone; but I never expected anything made by man could delude
Mr.<br>
 Acton, never!" And she went off into another mocking cackle,
and<br>
 all the idiots round her haw-hawed knowingly, as if they had
seen<br>
 the joke all along. I was too bewildered to reply, which was
on<br>
 the whole lucky. "I suppose I mustn't tell why I came to
give<br>
 quite a big sum in francs for this?" she went on, tapping
her<br>
 closed lips with her closed fan, and cocking her eye at us all
like<br>
 a parrot wanting to be coaxed to talk. "It's a queer story."</p>

<p>I didn't want to hear her anecdote, especially as I saw she
wanted<br>
 to tell it. What I DID want was to see that pendant again.
She<br>
 had thrust it back among her laces, only the loop which held it
to<br>
 the velvet being visible. It was set with three small
sapphires,<br>
 and even from a distance I clearly made them out to be
imitations,<br>
 and poor ones. I felt a queer thrill of self-mistrust. Was
the<br>
 large stone no better? Could I, even for an instant, have
been<br>
 dazzled by a sham, and a sham of that quality? The events of
the<br>
 evening had flurried and confused me. I wished to think them
over<br>
 in quiet. I would go to bed.</p>

<p>My rooms at the Manor are the best in the house. Leta will
have it<br>
 so. I must explain their position for a reason to be
understood<br>
 later. My bedroom is in the southeast angle of the house; it
opens<br>
 on one side into a sitting-room in the east corridor, the rest
of<br>
 which is taken up by the suite of rooms occupied by Tom and
Leta;<br>
 and on the other side into my bathroom, the first room in the
south<br>
 corridor, where the principal guest chambers are, to one of
which<br>
 it was originally the dressing-room. Passing this room I noticed
a<br>
 couple of housemaids preparing it for the night, and
discovered<br>
 with a shiver that Lady Carwitchet was to be my next-door
neighbor.<br>
 It gave me a turn.</p>

<p>The bishop's strange warning must have unnerved me. I was<br>
 perfectly safe from her ladyship. The disused door into her
room<br>
 was locked, and the key safe on the housekeeper's bunch. It
was<br>
 also undiscoverable on her side, the recess in which it stood
being<br>
 completely filled by a large wardrobe. On my side hung a
thick<br>
 sound-proof portiere. Nevertheless, I resolved not to use
that<br>
 room while she inhabited the next one. I removed my
possessions,<br>
 fastened the door of communication with my bedroom, and dragged
a<br>
 heavy ottoman across it.</p>

<p>Then I stowed away my emerald in my strong-box. It is built
into<br>
 the wall of my sitting-room, and masked by the lower part of an
old<br>
 carved oak bureau. I put away even the rings I wore
habitually,<br>
 keeping out only an inferior cat's-eye for workaday wear. I
had<br>
 just made all safe when Leta tapped at the door and came in to
wish<br>
 me good night. She looked flushed and harassed and ready to
cry.<br>
 "Uncle Paul," she began, "I want you to go up to town at once,
and<br>
 stay away till I send for you."</p>

<p>"My dear--!" I was too amazed to expostulate.</p>

<p>"We've got a--a pestilence among us," she declared, her
foot<br>
 tapping the ground angrily, "and the least we can do is to go
into<br>
 quarantine. Oh, I'm so sorry and so ashamed! The poor
bishop!<br>
 I'll take good care that no one else shall meet that woman
here.<br>
 You did your best for me, Uncle Paul, and managed admirably, but
it<br>
 was all no use. I hoped against hope that what between the dusk
of<br>
 the drawing-room before dinner, and being put at opposite ends
of<br>
 the table, we might get through without a meeting--"</p>

<p>"But, my dear, explain. Why shouldn't the bishop and Lady<br>
 Carwitchet meet? Why is it worse for him than anyone else?"</p>

<p>"Why? I thought everybody had heard of that dreadful wife of
his<br>
 who nearly broke his heart. If he married her for her money
it<br>
 served him right, but Lady Landor says she was very handsome
and<br>
 really in love with him at first. Then Lady Carwitchet got hold
of<br>
 her and led her into all sorts of mischief. She left her
husband--<br>
 he was only a rector with a country living in those days--and
went<br>
 to live in town, got into a horrid fast set, and made
herself<br>
 notorious. You MUST have heard of her."</p>

<p>"I heard of her sapphires, my dear. But I was in Brazil at
the<br>
 time."</p>

<p>"I wish you had been at home. You might have found her out.
She<br>
 was furious because her husband refused to let her wear the
great<br>
 Valdez sapphire. It had been in the Montanaro family for
some<br>
 generations, and her father settled it first on her and then on
her<br>
 little girl--the bishop being trustee. He felt obliged to
take<br>
 away the little girl, and send her off to be brought up by some
old<br>
 aunts in the country, and he locked up the sapphire. Lady<br>
 Carwitchet tells as a splendid joke how they got the copy made
in<br>
 Paris, and it did just as well for the people to stare at.
No<br>
 wonder the bishop hates the very name of the stone."</p>

<p><br>
 "How long will she stay here?" I asked dismally.</p>

<p>"Till Lord Carwitchet can come and escort her to Paris to
visit<br>
 some American friends. Goodness knows when that will be! Do go
up<br>
 to town, Uncle Paul!"</p>

<p>I refused indignantly. The very least I could do was to stand
by<br>
 my poor young relatives in their troubles and help them through.
I<br>
 did so. I wore that inferior cat's eye for six weeks!</p>

<p>It is a time I cannot think of even now without a shudder.
The<br>
 more I saw of that terrible old woman the more I detested her,
and<br>
 we saw a very great deal of her. Leta kept her word, and
neither<br>
 accepted nor gave invitations all that time. We were cut off
from<br>
 all society but that of old General Fairford, who would go
anywhere<br>
 and meet anyone to get a rubber after dinner; the doctor, a<br>
 sporting widower; and the Duberlys, a giddy, rather rackety
young<br>
 couple who had taken the Dower House for a year. Lady
Carwitchet<br>
 seemed perfectly content. She reveled in the soft living and
good<br>
 fare of the Manor House, the drives in Leta's big barouche,
and<br>
 Domenico's dinners, as one to whom short commons were not
unknown.<br>
 She had a hungry way of grabbing and grasping at everything
she<br>
 could--the shillings she won at whist, the best fruit at
dessert,<br>
 the postage stamps in the library inkstand--that was
infinitely<br>
 suggestive. Sometimes I could have pitied her, she was so
greedy,<br>
 so spiteful, so friendless. She always made me think of some<br>
 wicked old pirate putting into a peaceful port to provision
and<br>
 repair his battered old hulk, obliged to live on friendly
terms<br>
 with the natives, but his piratical old nostrils asniff for
plunder<br>
 and his piratical old soul longing to be off marauding once
more.<br>
 When would that be? Not till the arrival in Paris of her<br>
 distinguished American friends, of whom we heard a great
deal.<br>
 "Charming people, the Bokums of Chicago, the American branch of
the<br>
 English Beauchamps, you know!" They seemed to be taking an<br>
 unconscionable time to get there. She would have insisted on
being<br>
 driven over to Northchurch to call at the palace, but that
the<br>
 bishop was understood to be holding confirmations at the other
end<br>
 of the diocese.</p>

<p>I was alone in the house one afternoon sitting by my window,
toying<br>
 with the key of my safe, and wondering whether I dare treat
myself<br>
 to a peep at my treasures, when a suspicious movement in the
park<br>
 below caught my attention. A black figure certainly dodged
from<br>
 behind one tree to the next, and then into the shadow of the
park<br>
 paling instead of keeping to the footpath. It looked queer.
I<br>
 caught up my field glass and marked him at one point where he
was<br>
 bound to come into the open for a few steps. He crossed the
strip<br>
 of turf with giant strides and got into cover again, but not
quick<br>
 enough to prevent me recognizing him. It was--great
heavens!--the<br>
 bishop! In a soft hat pulled over his forehead, with a long
cloak<br>
 and a big stick, he looked like a poacher.</p>

<p>Guided by some mysterious instinct I hurried to meet him. I
opened<br>
 the conservatory door, and in he rushed like a hunted
rabbit.<br>
 Without explanation I led him up the wide staircase to my
room,<br>
 where he dropped into a chair and wiped his face.</p>

<p>"You are astonished, Mr. Acton," he panted. "I will
explain<br>
 directly. Thanks." He tossed off the glass of brandy I had
poured<br>
 out without waiting for the qualifying soda, and looked
better.</p>

<p>"I am in serious trouble. You can help me. I've had a shock
to-<br>
 day--a grievous shock." He stopped and tried to pull himself<br>
 together. "I must trust you implicitly, Mr. Acton, I have no<br>
 choice. Tell me what you think of this." He drew a case from
his<br>
 breast pocket and opened it. "I promised you should see the
Valdez<br>
 sapphire. Look there!"</p>

<p>The Valdez sapphire! A great big shining lump of blue
crystal--<br>
 flawless and of perfect color--that was all. I took it up,<br>
 breathed on it, drew out my magnifier, looked at it in one
light<br>
 and another. What was wrong with it? I could not say. Nine<br>
 experts out of ten would undoubtedly have pronounced the
stone<br>
 genuine. I, by virtue of some mysterious instinct that has<br>
 hitherto always guided me aright, was the unlucky tenth. I
looked<br>
 at the bishop. His eyes met mine. There was no need of
spoken<br>
 word between us.</p>

<p>"Has Lady Carwitchet shown you her sapphire?" was his most<br>
 unexpected question. "She has? Now, Mr. Acton, on your honor as
a<br>
 connoisseur and a gentleman, which of the two is the
Valdez?"</p>

<p>"Not this one." I could say naught else.</p>

<p>"You were my last hope." He broke off, and dropped his face on
his<br>
 folded arms with a groan that shook the table on which he
rested,<br>
 while I stood dismayed at myself for having let so hasty a
judgment<br>
 escape me. He lifted a ghastly countenance to me. "She vowed
she<br>
 would see me ruined and disgraced. I made her my enemy by
crossing<br>
 some of her schemes once, and she never forgives. She will
keep<br>
 her word. I shall appear before the world as a fraudulent
trustee.<br>
 I can neither produce the valuable confided to my charge nor
make<br>
 the loss good. I have only an incredible story to tell," be<br>
 dropped his head and groaned again. "Who will believe me?"</p>

<p>"I will, for one."</p>

<p>"Ah, you? Yes, you know her. She took my wife from me, Mr.
Acton.<br>
 Heaven only knows what the hold was that she had over poor
Mira.<br>
 She encouraged her to set me at defiance and eventually to
leave<br>
 me. She was answerable for all the scandalous folly and<br>
 extravagance of poor Mira's life in Paris--spare me the telling
of<br>
 the story. She left her at last to die alone and uncared for.
I<br>
 reached my wife to find her dying of a fever from which Lady<br>
 Carwitchet and her crew had fled. She was raving in delirium,
and<br>
 died without recognizing me. Some trouble she had been in which
I<br>
 must never know oppressed her. At the very last she roused from
a<br>
 long stupor and spoke to the nurse. 'Tell him to get the
sapphire<br>
 back--she stole it. She has robbed my child.' Those were her
last<br>
 words. The nurse understood no English, and treated them as<br>
 wandering; but I heard them, and knew she was sane when she
spoke."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"What could I? I saw Lady Carwitchet, who laughed at me,
and<br>
 defied me to make her confess or disgorge. I took the pendant
to<br>
 more than one eminent jeweler on pretense of having the
setting<br>
 seen to, and all have examined and admired without giving a hint
of<br>
 there being anything wrong. I allowed a celebrated mineralogist
to<br>
 see it; he gave no sign--"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are right and we are wrong."</p>

<p>"No, no. Listen. I heard of an old Dutchman celebrated for
his<br>
 imitations. I went to him, and he told me at once that he had
been<br>
 allowed by Montanaro to copy the Valdez--setting and all--for
the<br>
 Paris Exhibition. I showed him this, and he claimed it for his
own<br>
 work at once, and pointed out his private mark upon it. You
must<br>
 take your magnifier to find it; a Greek Beta. He also told me
that<br>
 he had sold it to Lady Carwitchet more than a year ago.</p>

<p>"It is a terrible position."</p>

<p>"It is. My co-trustee died lately. I have never dared to
have<br>
 another appointed. I am bound to hand over the sapphire to
my<br>
 daughter on her marriage, if her husband consents to take the
name<br>
 of Montanaro."</p>

<p>The bishop's face was ghastly pale, and the moisture started
on his<br>
 brow. I racked my brain for some word of comfort.</p>

<p>"Miss Panton may never marry."</p>

<p>"But she will!" he shouted. "That is the blow that has been
dealt<br>
 me to-day. My chaplain--actually, my chaplain--tells me that he
is<br>
 going out as a temperance missionary to equatorial Africa, and
has<br>
 the assurance to add that he believes my daughter is not
indisposed<br>
 to accompany him!" His consummating wrath acted as a
momentary<br>
 stimulant. He sat upright, his eyes flashing and his brow<br>
 thunderous. I felt for that chaplain. Then he collapsed<br>
 miserably. "The sapphires will have to be produced,
identified,<br>
 revalued. How shall I come out of it? Think of the disgrace,
the<br>
 ripping up of old scandals! Even if I were to compound with
Lady<br>
 Carwitchet, the sum she hinted at was too monstrous. She
wants<br>
 more than my money. Help me, Mr. Acton! For the sake of your
own<br>
 family interests, help me!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon--family interests? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"If my daughter is childless, her next of kin is poor
Marmaduke<br>
 Panton, who is dying at Cannes, not married, or likely to
marry;<br>
 and failing him, your nephew, Sir Thomas Acton, succeeds."</p>

<p>My nephew Tom! Leta, or Leta's baby, might come to be the
possible<br>
 inheritor of the great Valdez sapphire! The blood rushed to
my<br>
 head as I looked at the great shining swindle before me.
"What<br>
 diabolic jugglery was at work when the exchange was made?" I<br>
 demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>"It must have been on the last occasion of her wearing the<br>
 sapphires in London. I ought never to have let her out of my<br>
 sight"</p>

<p>"You must put a stop to Miss Panton's marriage in the first
place,"<br>
 I pronounced as autocratically as he could have done
himself.</p>

<p>"Not to be thought of," he admitted helplessly. "Mira has my
force<br>
 of character. She knows her rights, and she will have her
jewels.<br>
 I want you to take charge of the--thing for me. If it's in
the<br>
 house she'll make me produce it. She'll inquire at the
banker's.<br>
 If YOU have it we can gain time, if but for a day or two."
He<br>
 broke off. Carriage wheels were crashing on the gravel
outside.<br>
 We looked at one another in consternation. Flight was
imperative.<br>
 I hurried him downstairs and out of the conservatory just as
the<br>
 door bell rang. I think we both lost our heads in the
confusion.<br>
 He shoved the case into my hands, and I pocketed it, without
a<br>
 thought of the awful responsibility I was incurring, and saw
him<br>
 disappear into the shelter of the friendly night.</p>

<p>When I think of what my feelings were that evening--of my
murderous<br>
 hatred of that smirking, jesting Jezebel who sat opposite me
at<br>
 dinner, my wrathful indignation at the thought of the poor
little<br>
 expected heir defrauded ere his birth; of the crushing contempt
I<br>
 felt for myself and the bishop as a pair of witless idiots
unable<br>
 to see our way out of the dilemma; all this boiling and
surging<br>
 through my soul, I can only wonder--Domenico having given
himself a<br>
 holiday, and the kitchen maid doing her worst and
wickedest--that<br>
 gout or jaundice did not put an end to this story at once.</p>

<p>"Uncle Paul!" Leta was looking her sweetest when she tripped
into<br>
 my room next morning. "I've news for you. She," pointing a<br>
 delicate forefinger in the direction of the corridor, "is
going!<br>
 Her Bokums have reached Paris at last, and sent for her to
join<br>
 them at the Grand Hotel."</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck. The longed-for deliverance had but come
to<br>
 remove hopelessly and forever out of my reach Lady Carwitchet
and<br>
 the great Valdez sapphire.</p>

<p>"Why, aren't you overjoyed? I am. We are going to celebrate
the<br>
 event by a dinner party. Tom's hospitable soul is vexed by
the<br>
 lack of entertainment we had provided her. We must ask the<br>
 Brownleys some day or other, and they will be delighted to
meet<br>
 anything in the way of a ladyship, or such smart folks as
the<br>
 Duberly-Parkers. Then we may as well have the Blomfields, and
air<br>
 that awful modern Sevres dessert service she gave us when we
were<br>
 married." I had no objection to make, and she went on, rubbing
her<br>
 soft cheek against my shoulder like the purring little cat she
was:<br>
 "Now I want you to do something to please me--and Mrs.
Blomfield.<br>
 She has set her heart on seeing your rubies, and though I know
you<br>
 hate her about as much as you do that Sevres china--"</p>

<p>"What! Wear my rubies with that! I won't. I'll tell you what
I<br>
 will do, though. I've got some carbuncles as big as prize<br>
 gooseberries, a whole set. Then you have only to put those<br>
 Bohemian glass vases and candelabra on the table, and let
your<br>
 gardener do his worst with his great forced, scentless,
vulgar<br>
 blooms, and we shall all be in keeping." Leta pouted. An
idea<br>
 struck me. "Or I'll do as you wish, on one condition. You
get<br>
 Lady Carwitchet to wear her big sapphire, and don't tell her I
wish<br>
 it."</p>

<p>I lived through the next few days as one in some evil dream.
The<br>
 sapphires, like twin specters, haunted me day and night. Was
ever<br>
 man so tantalized? To hold the shadow and see the substance<br>
 dangled temptingly within reach. The bishop made no sign of<br>
 ridding me of my unwelcome charge, and the thought of what
might<br>
 happen in a case of burglary--fire--earthquake--made me start
and<br>
 tremble at all sorts of inopportune moments.</p>

<p>I kept faith with Leta, and reluctantly produced my
beautiful<br>
 rubies on the night of her dinner party. Emerging from my room
I<br>
 came full upon Lady Carwitchet in the corridor. She was
dressed<br>
 for dinner, and at her throat I caught the blue gleam of the
great<br>
 sapphire. Leta had kept faith with me. I don't know what I<br>
 stammered in reply to her ladyship's remarks; my whole soul
was<br>
 absorbed in the contemplation of the intoxicating loveliness of
the<br>
 gem. THAT a Palais Royal deception! Incredible! My fingers<br>
 twitched, my breath came short and fierce with the lust of<br>
 possession. She must have seen the covetous glare in my eyes.
A<br>
 look of gratified spiteful complacency overspread her features,
as<br>
 she swept on ahead and descended the stairs before me. I
followed<br>
 her to the drawing-room door. She stopped suddenly, and
murmuring<br>
 something unintelligible hurried back again.</p>

<p>Everybody was assembled there that I expected to see, with
an<br>
 addition. Not a welcome one by the look on Tom's face. He
stood<br>
 on the hearthrug conversing with a great hulking,
high-shouldered<br>
 fellow, sallow-faced, with a heavy mustache and drooping
eyelids,<br>
 from the corners of which flashed out a sudden suspicious look
as I<br>
 approached, which lighted up into a greedy one as it rested on
my<br>
 rubies, and seemed unaccountably familiar to me, till Lady<br>
 Carwitchet tripping past me exclaimed:</p>

<p>"He has come at last! My naughty, naughty boy! Mr. Acton, this
is<br>
 my son, Lord Carwitchet!"</p>

<p>I broke off short in the midst of my polite acknowledgments
to<br>
 stare blankly at her. The sapphire was gone! A great gilt
cross,<br>
 with a Scotch pebble like an acid drop, was her sole
decoration.</p>

<p>"I had to put my pendant away," she explained confidentially;
"the<br>
 clasp had got broken somehow." I didn't believe a word.</p>

<p>Lord Carwitchet contributed little to the general
entertainment at<br>
 dinner, but fell into confidential talk with Mrs.
Duberly-Parker.<br>
 I caught a few unintelligible remarks across the table. They<br>
 referred, I subsequently discovered, to the lady's little book
on<br>
 Northchurch races, and I recollected that the Spring Meeting
was<br>
 on, and to-morrow "Cup Day." After dinner there was great
talk<br>
 about getting up a party to go on General Fairford's drag.
Lady<br>
 Carwitchet was in ecstasies and tried to coax me into
joining.<br>
 Leta declined positively. Tom accepted sulkily.</p>

<p>The look in Lord Carwitchet's eye returned to my mind as I
locked<br>
 up my rubies that night. It made him look so like his mother!
I<br>
 went round my fastenings with unusual care. Safe and closets
and<br>
 desk and doors, I tried them all. Coming at last to the
bathroom,<br>
 it opened at once. It was the housemaid's doing. She had<br>
 evidently taken advantage of my having abandoned the room to
give<br>
 it "a thorough spring cleaning," and I anathematized her.
The<br>
 furniture was all piled together and veiled with sheets, the
carpet<br>
 and felt curtain were gone, there were new brooms about. As
I<br>
 peered around, a voice close at my ear made me jump--Lady<br>
 Carwitchet's!</p>

<p><br>
 "I tell you I have nothing, not a penny! I shall have to borrow
my<br>
 train fare before I can leave this. They'll be glad enough to
lend<br>
 it."</p>

<p>Not only had the portiere been removed, but the door behind it
had<br>
 been unlocked and left open for convenience of dusting behind
the<br>
 wardrobe. I might as well have been in the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me," I recognized Carwitchet's growl. "You've not
been<br>
 here all this time for nothing. You've been collecting for a<br>
 Kilburn cot or getting subscriptions for the distressed
Irish<br>
 landlords. I know you. Now I'm not going to see myself ruined
for<br>
 the want of a paltry hundred or so. I tell you the colt is a
dead<br>
 certainty. If I could have got a thousand or two on him last
week,<br>
 we might have ended our dog days millionaires. Hand over what
you<br>
 can. You've money's worth, if not money. Where's that
sapphire<br>
 you stole?"</p>

<p>"I didn't. I can show you the receipted bill. All I possess
is<br>
 honestly come by. What could you do with it, even if I gave
it<br>
 you? You couldn't sell it as the Valdez, and you can't get it
cut<br>
 up as you might if it were real."</p>

<p>"If it's only bogus, why are you always in such a flutter
about it?<br>
 I'll do something with it, never fear. Hand over."</p>

<p>"I can't. I haven't got it. I had to raise something on it
before<br>
 I left town."</p>

<p>"Will you swear it's not in that wardrobe? I dare say you
will. I<br>
 mean to see. Give me those keys."</p>

<p>I heard a struggle and a jingle, then the wardrobe door must
have<br>
 been flung open, for a streak of light struck through a crack
in<br>
 the wood of the back. Creeping close and peeping through, I
could<br>
 see an awful sight. Lady Carwitchet in a flannel wrapper,
minus<br>
 hair, teeth, complexion, pointing a skinny forefinger that
quivered<br>
 with rage at her son, who was out of the range of my vision.</p>

<p>"Stop that, and throw those keys down here directly, or I'll
rouse<br>
 the house. Sir Thomas is a magistrate, and will lock you up
as<br>
 soon as look at you." She clutched at the bell rope as she
spoke.<br>
 "I'll swear I'm in danger of my life from you and give you
in<br>
 charge. Yes, and when you're in prison I'll keep you there
till<br>
 you die. I've often thought I'd do it. How about the hotel<br>
 robberies last summer at Cowes, eh? Mightn't the police be<br>
 grateful for a hint or two? And how about--"</p>

<p>The keys fell with a crash on the bed, accompanied by some
bad<br>
 language in an apologetic tone, and the door slammed to. I
crept<br>
 trembling to bed.</p>

<p>This new and horrible complication of the situation filled me
with<br>
 dismay. Lord Carwitchet's wolfish glance at my rubies took a
new<br>
 meaning. They were safe enough, I believed--but the sapphire!
If<br>
 he disbelieved his mother, how long would she be able to keep
it<br>
 from his clutches? That she had some plot of her own of which
the<br>
 bishop would eventually be the victim I did not doubt, or why
had<br>
 she not made her bargain with him long ago? But supposing she
took<br>
 fright, lost her head, allowed her son to wrest the jewel from
her,<br>
 or gave consent to its being mutilated, divided! I lay in a
cold<br>
 perspiration till morning.</p>

<p>My terrors haunted me all day. They were with me at breakfast
time<br>
 when Lady Carwitchet, tripping in smiling, made a last attempt
to<br>
 induce me to accompany her and keep her "bad, bad boy" from
getting<br>
 among "those horrid betting men."</p>

<p>They haunted me through the long peaceful day with Leta and
the<br>
 tete-a-tete dinner, but they swarmed around and beset me
sorest<br>
 when, sitting alone over my sitting-room fire, I listened for
the<br>
 return of the drag party. I read my newspaper and brewed
myself<br>
 some hot strong drink, but there comes a time of night when no
fire<br>
 can warm and no drink can cheer. The bishop's despairing face
kept<br>
 me company, and his troubles and the wrongs of the future heir
took<br>
 possession of me. Then the uncanny noises that make all old
houses<br>
 ghostly during the small hours began to make themselves
heard.<br>
 Muffled footsteps trod the corridor, stopping to listen at
every<br>
 door, door latches gently clicked, boards creaked
unreasonably,<br>
 sounds of stealthy movements came from the locked-up bathroom.
The<br>
 welcome crash of wheels at last, and the sound of the
front-door<br>
 bell. I could hear Lady Carwitchet making her shrill adieux to
her<br>
 friends and her steps in the corridor. She was softly humming
a<br>
 little song as she approached. I heard her unlock her bedroom
door<br>
 before she entered--an odd thing to do. Tom came sleepily<br>
 stumbling to his room later. I put my head out. "Where is
Lord<br>
 Carwitchet?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you seen him? He left us hours ago. Not come home,
eh?<br>
 Well, he's welcome to stay away. I don't want to see more of
him."<br>
 Tom's brow was dark and his voice surly. "I gave him to
understand<br>
 as much." Whatever had happened, Tom was evidently too
disgusted<br>
 to explain just then.</p>

<p>I went back to my fire unaccountably relieved, and brewed
myself<br>
 another and a stronger brew. It warmed me this time, but
excited<br>
 me foolishly. There must be some way out of the difficulty.
I<br>
 felt now as if I could almost see it if I gave my mind to it.
Why--<br>
 suppose--there might be no difficulty after all! The bishop was
a<br>
 nervous old gentleman. He might have been mistaken all
through,<br>
 Bogaerts might have been mistaken, I might--no. I could not
have<br>
 been mistaken--or I thought not. I fidgeted and fumed and
argued<br>
 with myself till I found I should have no peace of mind without
a<br>
 look at the stone in my possession, and I actually went to the
safe<br>
 and took the case out.</p>

<p>The sapphire certainly looked different by lamplight. I sat
and<br>
 stared, and all but over-persuaded my better judgment into
giving<br>
 it a verdict. Bogaerts's mark--I suddenly remembered it. I
took<br>
 my magnifier and held the pendant to the light. There,
scratched<br>
 upon the stone, was the Greek Beta! There came a tap on my
door,<br>
 and before I could answer, the handle turned softly and Lord<br>
 Carwitchet stood before me. I whipped the case into my
dressing-<br>
 gown pocket and stared at him. He was not pleasant to look
at,<br>
 especially at that time of night. He had a disheveled,
desperate<br>
 air, his voice was hoarse, his red-rimmed eyes wild.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he began civilly enough. "I saw your
light<br>
 burning, and thought, as we go by the early train to-morrow,
you<br>
 might allow me to consult you now on a little business of my<br>
 mother's." His eyes roved about the room. Was he trying to
find<br>
 the whereabouts of my safe? "You know a lot about precious
stones,<br>
 don't you?"</p>

<p>"So my friends are kind enough to say. Won't you sit down? I
have<br>
 unluckily little chance of indulging the taste on my own
account,"<br>
 was my cautious reply.</p>

<p>"But you've written a book about them, and know them when you
see<br>
 them, don't you? Now my mother has given me something, and
would<br>
 like you to give a guess at its value. Perhaps you can put me
in<br>
 the way of disposing of it?"</p>

<p>"I certainly can do so if it is worth anything. Is that it?"
I<br>
 was in a fever of excitement, for I guessed what was clutched
in<br>
 his palm. He held out to me the Valdez sapphire.</p>

<p>How it shone and sparkled like a great blue star! I made
myself a<br>
 deprecating smile as I took it from him, but how dare I call
it<br>
 false to its face? As well accuse the sun in heaven of being
a<br>
 cheap imitation. I faltered and prevaricated feebly. Where was
my<br>
 moral courage, and where was the good, honest, thumping lie
that<br>
 should have aided me? "I have the best authority for
recognizing<br>
 this as a very good copy of a famous stone in the possession of
the<br>
 Bishop of Northchurch." His scowl grew so black that I saw
he<br>
 believed me, and I went on more cheerily: "This was manufactured
by<br>
 Johannes Bogaerts--I can give you his address, and you can
make<br>
 inquiries yourself--by special permission of the then owner,
the<br>
 late Leone Montanaro."</p>

<p>"Hand it back!" he interrupted (his other remarks were
outrageous,<br>
 but satisfactory to hear); but I waved him off. I couldn't give
it<br>
 up. It fascinated me. I toyed with it, I caressed it. I made
it<br>
 display its different tones of color. I must see the two
stones<br>
 together. I must see it outshine its paltry rival. It was a<br>
 whimsical frenzy that seized me--I can call it by no other
name.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see the original? Curiously enough, I have
it<br>
 here. The bishop has left it in my charge."</p>

<p>The wolfish light flamed up in Carwitchet's eyes as I drew
forth<br>
 the case. He laid the Valdez down on a sheet of paper, and I<br>
 placed the other, still in its case, beside it. In that
moment<br>
 they looked identical, except for the little loop of sham
stones,<br>
 replaced by a plain gold band in the bishop's jewel.
Carwitchet<br>
 leaned across the table eagerly, the table gave a lurch, the
lamp<br>
 tottered, crashed over, and we were left in semidarkness.</p>

<p>"Don't stir!" Carwitchet shouted. "The paraffin is all over
the<br>
 place!" He seized my sofa blanket, and flung it over the
table<br>
 while I stood helpless. "There, that's safe now. Have you
candles<br>
 on the chimney-piece? I've got matches."</p>

<p>He looked very white and excited as he lit up. "Might have
been an<br>
 awkward job with all that burning paraffin running about," he
said<br>
 quite pleasantly. "I hope no real harm is done." I was
lifting<br>
 the rug with shaking hands. The two stones lay as I had
placed<br>
 them. No! I nearly dropped it back again. It was the stone
in<br>
 the case that had the loop with the three sham sapphires!</p>

<p>Carwitchet picked the other up hastily. "So you say this
is<br>
 rubbish?" he asked, his eyes sparkling wickedly, and an attempt
at<br>
 mortification in his tone.</p>

<p>"Utter rubbish!" I pronounced, with truth and decision,
snapping up<br>
 the case and pocketing it. "Lady Carwitchet must have known
it."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, it's disappointing, isn't it? Good-by, we shall
not<br>
 meet again."</p>

<p>I shook hands with him most cordially. "Good-by, Lord
Carwitchet.<br>
 SO glad to have met you and your mother. It has been a source
of<br>
 the GREATEST pleasure, I assure you."</p>

<p>I have never seen the Carwitchets since. The bishop drove
over<br>
 next day in rather better spirits. Miss Panton had refused
the<br>
 chaplain.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter, my lord," I said to him heartily. "We've
all<br>
 been under some strange misconception. The stone in your<br>
 possession is the veritable one. I could swear to that
anywhere.<br>
 The sapphire Lady Carwitchet wears is only an excellent
imitation,<br>
 and--I have seen it with my own eyes--is the one bearing
Bogaerts's<br>
 mark, the Greek Beta."</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
